    "content": "SaitaRealty/SaitaChain: Lets Talk 20.12.2023\n#SaitaRealty, #SaitaChain, #STC \n\nHuge updates for SaitaRealty ecosystem. No doubts! \n\nSummary notes:\n\nNaz:\n\nSR buy/sell/transfer tax decreased from 5 to 3. All 3% dedicated for marketing.\n\nToday was the NFT refund initiative. Who bought either Neon or Paper village NFT they have been refunded. Refund was in SaitaRealty tokens on BNB chain. \n\nRight after new whitepaper has been released.\nSaitaRealty started staking on BNB chain (3%, 6%, 9% \u003d 30 / 60 / 90 days). https://dex.saita.pro (make sure you have BNB chain selected)\n\nI was at Christmas Binance event tonight, it was absolutely fabulous. Going  to these events, give you confirmation that what we are doing, is definitely worth.\n\nSpiggy:\n\nBig day for SaitaRealty\n\nNew beginning for SR! With refund for NFT holders. That was part of the plan that we decided to go through. Not an easy decision for everything what these NFT represented.\n\nIt is a new direction, new team, new vision.\n\nChoice for everyone. It is fair to refund every SR NFT holder.\n\nUntil now there was no results with NFTs. We want to move SR and today is a good opportunity to start again, with clear new direction, vision.\n\nWhitepaper. It is very easy one, easy roadmap. We decided to focus on real estate activity. We want to bring every SR holder into this activity and we want everyone to benefit from it. We are bringing utility into a project. Community will have their role to play. This is now a teamwork.\n\nWe really want to work all together. We do not want to put some investors on side.\n\nEveryone on the same level and start again. Work together.\n\nAfter platform will be live, it will make sense. All what we are doing.\n\nNew team \u003d new changes. We had to do changes for the sake of project.\n\nSaitaRealty will be L1 Blockchain later on SaitaChain.\n\nNaz:\nWhat happen to property in Dubai?\n\nSpiggy:\n\nProperty is still in our hands and we plan to sell it in Q1 2024. Meeting with real estate agent. Profit on the sell for property will be still shared with NFT holders. Lets play fairly, it is part of last plan, what has been brought by previous team.\n\nPlease keep your NFT :)\n\nAfter property will be sold. Another snapshot will be taken for NFT holders, after it will be sold, NFT holders will get share of profit.\n\nCryptoAlert\n\nI never heard of project which did refund for discountinued project. This is the first of the kind! This ecosystem is not here for people money, but to improve overall cryptocurrency.\n\nSpiggy:\n\nWe want to build something, main focus is the community, investors. We are with this new direction, pushing people to be part of it. They will make project work. (more than us). Community will play big part. WE will have to make this platform to know everywhere. Communility.\n\nNaz:\n\nEnjoy these benefits of BNB staking for SR, due to super low gas fees.\n\nSTC announcement for BNB staking pools will be announced in due time. \n\nCryptoAlert:\n\nWhen Mkay said something, he always delivered. I am very happy with whitepaper.\n\nNaz:\n\nChristmas started on 13th of November. Where SaitaChain roadmap was released. 7 days later Alpha test net, some days after STC coin was born. STC is traded on both ETH and BNB. There has been revitalization for project.\n\n20th of December and we are here with revitalization of SaitaRealty with new fresh direction. Getting whole ecosystem restored was put very well. Even for SaitaRealty pair with BNB was introduced. \n\nAccessiblity is much bigger for both projects. New build for SaitaPro (new UI), will be sent next week to App store and Google store. Few things coming out, always follow main channel (SaitaChainCoin and Mkay). \n\nQuestions:\n\nIs there any plans to apply with Ledger to support STC and SaitaRealty?\n\nRequest can be put in and it is just waiting game. Sometimes you have to wait. After putting all requests in, to have your logo, your price etc. It is just matter waiting for approval and to get approved. \n\nSaitaRealty in ETH? Do we need to migrate? \n\nThis is up to holders. BNB pair is open. No need to move from ETH. Both pairs will stay. If you will have option to move later to SaitaChain as well. So up to you (ETH, BNB, SaitaChain). XBridge will be used to move.\n\nDo we need to stake SaitaRealty tokens for profit?\n\nNot required to stake any tokens. Just hold NFT.\n\nHow real estate agents could get involved?\n\nThat is very good question, let me explain.\nWe will create website for real estate platform, we are already in partnership with Real estate company. We will list around 20 properties, they will give us right to list them. We need to promote that platform, we need to bring potentional investor in Dubai. You will get in touch with Real Estate company. through real estate platform. SaitaRealty will get commision for that sell. It will be split between 50% will be used for marketing and development for SR. 30% to buy and burn tokens. 20% will be going into anyone who will bring buyer into our platform.\n\nWe want to expand worldwide, based on how it will go in Dubai. Posibilities are endless. SaitaRealty L1 will come next year.\n\nWebsite will be opened. Selling, reselling in Dubai is very easy. \n\nWill we have some commisions / referal on the platform? For this 20% on platform? Do they need to register or to be SaitaRealty holders?\n\nTo be part of that, you need to be SaitaRealty holder. (Styg note: Quantity was not defined on the space)\n\nAs someone who is holder? How I will benefit in holding the tokens?\n\nYou will have staking option.\n\nIf we will do this program? Will be there some calculator to see end result? To see benefit of the platform?\n\nWe will act as a bridge betwen buyer/seller and Real Estate agency. You will be redirected to agent. How it can be done, financial. We will just bring potentional investors to our partner in Dubai. That Real Estate company accept CryptoCurrency. Comission once sales will happen, after it will be agreed how comission will be paid. (ETH, SR, etc)\nSell will be happening on platform. For comission to be allocated, they need to be bought in SaitaRealty and after there will buy and burn for SaitaRealty.\n\nSince Whitepaper was just released today. We are open for any suggestion.\n\nEverything is done in mind to support SaitaRealty price, to bring as many positivie factors to SaitaRealty.",

    "content": "Great Art ≠ Great PFP\n\nWorking on our avatars for \n@Persona_Journey\n and collecting nfts since 2021, I\u0027ve observed a common misconception that great art automatically makes for great profile pictures.\n\nWhen admiring a high-quality, detailed illustration in your feed, it\u0027s easy to appreciate its craftsmanship and fall in love with it.\n\nBut remember, just because it looks amazing as a standalone piece doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027ll work well as an avatar in a collection on the long run \n\nTo create a successful line of avatars, I believe there are some crucial elements to nail correctly.\n\n1. Efficiency in small sizes \u0026 Recognizability\n\nIn small sizes, details can be lost. Avatars are mostly viewed on social feeds, so you need a distinct silhouette and clear, recognizable elements.\n\nTake y00ts, for example - their silhouettes are unmistakable, with a simple color scheme and distinctive elements that really stand out.\nDesaturated bright colors for backgrounds are a great trick to focus attention on the character and highlight its features especially in small sizes, removing a lot of visual noise.  \n\n2. Collection Cohesion\n\nThe second most common place where collections are seen is on marketplaces. \n\nRare elements should be easily noticeable when avatars stand next to each other, creating a desire to collect them.\nAzuki is a fantastic example in this regard. They\u0027ve nailed everything from background balance to clothing, to rare traits and facial expression variety. \n\nCreating an appealing, varied and cohesive collection is key.\n\n3. Relatability  \n\nFor people to use them as a profile picture for their digital identity, avatars must be relatable. \n\nMany collections with amazing art fail because they don\u0027t resonate as a PFP.   \n\nStory time: I once amassed a lot of Superlative Secret Society pieces because I loved the art (still do!)\nHowever, the art wasn’t suited at all for a 11,000 avatar collection. In small sizes, they appeared too similar, they weren\u0027t relatable, rare elements were impossible to figure out.\n\nThere are exceptions that might defy these principles and still succeed in the long run of course, like meme projects or heavy utility nfts (game / defi / you name it). \n\nOn \n@Persona_Journey\n , we’re all about creating iconic avatars designed to stand the test of time... while creating tangible utilities in our ecosystem. \n\nBest of both worlds, let’s get it!

    "content": "A guide for builders on how to properly create and manage inscriptions on #MultiversX\nMultiversX\n#\n\nMultiversX is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to revolutionize the way we interact with payments, DeFi, NFTs, AI and everything in real world applications and virtual worlds. \nInscriptions could play a crucial role in the vision, enabling the creation of a rich and immersive virtual environment. Also, they are a powerful tool in order to keep track of history, ownership and existence of authenticated data. \nEverything that is saved and authenticated on blockchain, cannot be rewritten further in the line. So history is going to be safe. Think about safely saving hashes/cryptographic proofs of videos, audios, books, any official documents. All of those are inscriptions, and are in such a form that complete data and verification is off-chain. Practically speaking inscriptions are already on the MultiversX chain, almost from day 1, we have serious companies using txData to save into history tracking (packets, data, certificates).\n\nSpecifications\n Inscriptions are unique and indivisible tokens that can store arbitrary data, such as text, images, audio, or even other inscriptions. The storage should be kept on the txData, not saved into the trie, making it cheaper. Authentication of the data will come from indexers or a set of smart contracts.\n\n Inscriptions have a unique identifier, such as a UUID or a random number. This prevents duplication and ensures the integrity of data. The validity of uniqueness is the job of an off-chain process, or at creation time, the job of a Smart Contract.\n\n Inscriptions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and tamper-proof data storage. When a transaction containing an inscription is executed on the chain (it might mean only a transfer from user A to B), the complete transaction is saved in the blockchain database as executed transactions. And using the txHash which can be seen on the blockHeader, any off-chain application can identify the inscription. This ensures that the data stored in inscriptions cannot be altered or deleted.\n\n Inscriptions can be owned by users, allowing them to control and manage the data within.\n\nInscriptions can be transferred between users, enabling the sharing and exchange of data. The ownership history of inscriptions can be traced back to their creation, ensuring transparency and provenance. This is essential for tracking the ownership and usage of digital assets.\n\nInscriptions can be used to create sophisticated applications, such as provenance tracking, ownership verification, and smart contracts. They can be programmed to interact with other smart contracts, enabling a wide range of functionalities. This allows for the creation of sophisticated applications that leverage the power of the blockchain. Or inscriptions can even act as self executing programs as well.\n\nLet’s get more technical and go step by step:\n\n1. Create an inscription:\na. Data Preparation: prepare the data that will be stored in the inscription. This can be of any type of data, such as text, images, audio, or even other inscriptions. The data should be in a format that can be serialized into a JSON object.\nEnsure the data is in a format that can be serialized into a JSON object.\nSanitize the data to remove any malicious or invalid characters.\nEncode the data into a Base64 string for compatibility with the blockchain protocol.\n\nb. Signature Generation: generate a cryptographic signature for the inscription data. This signature will be used to prove that the inscription was created by the owner. It is generated using the owner\u0027s private key.\nObtain the owner\u0027s private key.\nCreate a hash of the inscription data using a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256.\nSign the hash using the owner\u0027s private key.\nConvert the signature into a Base64 string for storage on the blockchain.\nSave the hash as an inscription identifier.\n\nc. Inscription Creation: submitting the inscription data, signature, and other metadata to the blockchain network. The blockchain will verify the signature and store the inscription on the ledger.\nPrepare a transaction object that includes the inscription data, signature, and other metadata.\nSign the transaction object using the owner\u0027s private key.\nBroadcast the transaction to the MultiversX blockchain network.\nOnce the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the inscription is considered to be created and stored on the ledger. The creator becomes the owner of the inscription, and the inscription can be retrieved and transferred using the owner\u0027s public key.\n\n2. Retrieval/validity of inscriptions:\nOnce an inscription is created, an off-chain application needs to be created, to monitor the history and track the validity of such information. (Later, we can speak about how this tracking could be created in a smart contract, but that will mean more development, right now it is better to go through the off-chain process as it is needed anyway).\n\nTechnically speaking, we need to use the indexer data, add a set of validity functions and create the new database of inscriptions. This database can always be recreated by running an import-db, meaning reprocessing the transactions as they were done by the validators. The order of transactions even right now can be taken from indexer/bigQuery implementations which are open sourced.\n\nAs the transaction is indexed, the new program has to check whether it is an inscription (is txData an JSON with the needed 3 fields: identifier, data and signature). Owner check: owner field is equal with sender, Signature check: inscription data signed by owner. Also check in case of new inscription creation (sender \u003d\u003d destination), that identifier (which is hash of Data) is unique. Only if all these checks go through, then you can add the inscription to the inscriptions DataBase.\n\nFurthermore, every inscription has to keep all its tracking data. From their original owner, to the latest owner. As in the end, this is the way a user can determine whether an InscriptionNFT is the bluechip/official one or not.\n\n3. Transfers of an inscription:\nThe workings of the owner field.\nTo ensure that inscriptions cannot be created or transferred by anyone other than the owner. The owner field is used to validate the signature of the inscription, which ensures that only the owner can create or transfer the inscription.\nTo allow for the tracking of the ownership history of an inscription. The owner field is stored on the blockchain, which allows anyone to see who the current owner of an inscription is. This can be useful for applications such as provenance tracking and ownership verification.\nTo facilitate the creation of smart contracts that manage inscriptions. Smart contracts can use the owner field to determine who is allowed to perform certain actions on an inscription, such as transferring ownership or modifying the data.\n\nThe ownership of an inscription is immutably stored on the blockchain, and the owner field is used to verify that the person transferring the inscription is actually the owner. It ensures that inscriptions can only be transferred to authorised recipients, and it provides a tamper-proof record of the ownership history of each inscription.\nIn transaction 1, Alice creates an inscription and sets herself as the owner. The owner field is set to Alice\u0027s address, which is a unique identifier that can be used to verify her ownership of the inscription.\nIn transaction 2, Alice transfers the inscription to Bob. The owner field is updated to Bob\u0027s address, which means that Bob is now the owner of the inscription. This change is recorded on the blockchain, and it is impossible to change the owner field without the owner\u0027s private key.\nExample: examining the ownership history of a CryptoPunk inscription is a crucial step in verifying its authenticity. By tracing the provenance of the inscription back to its creation, you can determine whether it was originally created by the official creator of CryptoPunks. If the inscription can be traced back to the original creator, then there is a strong likelihood that it is authentic. However, if the inscription has been transferred or altered in any way, then its authenticity may be compromised.\n\nNext, let’s discuss trading:\nEscrow and Payment: An escrow service can be used to facilitate the transaction. The escrow service will hold the ordinal until the buyer has paid the agreed-upon price. Once the payment is received, the escrow service will transfer the ordinal to the buyer. Threshold signature over an account like this can boost its security.\n\nDigital Marketplace:\nOne of the harder things on the smart contract is that you cannot actually verify the list of ownership of the inscriptions as it was saved only on txStorage which is not accessible by the SC. One developer could rely on oracles to validate every inscription deposit, but it can cost a lot of gas. Instead of this, the SC could accept simply all the inscriptions thrown at him, and in the frontend the user will see the reliable data.\n\n Inscription Listing: \n- Inscription Description: The seller provides a detailed description of the inscription, including its identifier, type, data, and any relevant metadata. This helps potential buyers understand the inscription and its value.\n- Desired Price: The seller sets a desired price for the inscription, which reflects their assessment of its value and the market conditions. This price is displayed on the marketplace for prospective buyers to see.\nMarketplace saves data as Alice listed Inscription 0x123. If the same inscription is deposited by Bob as well, on withdrawal of inscriptions, each user can only withdraw the inscription they themselves deposited. In this case, on the marketplace both Inscriptions 0x123 can exist, one has the previous Owner of Bob and the other to Alice. So on withdrawal, Alice will withdraw only the inscriptions whose previous owner is herself.\n\n Bidding Process:\n- Buyer\u0027s Interest: Interested buyers can view the listing and express their interest by submitting bids. The bid amount represents the maximum price they are willing to pay for the inscription.\n- The Buyer will not only Bid for inscription 0x123, but for Inscription 0x123 whose previous owner is Bob\n- Bidding Competition: The marketplace automatically compares bids and determines the highest bidder.\n\nSmart Contract Execution:\n- Bid Acceptance: Once the smart contract identifies the highest bidder, it triggers the acceptance of the bid. This initiates the process of transferring ownership of the inscription to the buyer.\n- Payment Processing: The smart contract will facilitate the payment process.\n- Inscription Transfer: Upon successful payment, the smart contract transfers ownership of the inscription to the buyer. This update is recorded on the blockchain, reflecting the change in ownership.\n\n Ownership Transfer and Completion:\n- Updated Ownership Record: The blockchain maintains an updated record of the inscription\u0027s ownership, reflecting the transfer from the seller to the buyer.\n- Transaction Confirmation: The buyer receives confirmation of the transaction, including the inscription identifier, the purchase price, and the updated ownership record.\n\nConclusion\n\nInscriptions are poised to reshape the digital landscape, and developers hold the key to unlocking this transformative potential. Inscriptions offer a groundbreaking solution for securely storing and transferring ownership of unique digital assets, opening up a world of possibilities for innovation and creativity.\n\nFrom revolutionizing the art world to forging new economies within virtual worlds, inscriptions have the power to transform industries and enhance user experiences. Developers, you are at the forefront of this revolution, with the opportunity to build groundbreaking applications that redefine how we interact with the digital world.\n\nThe time is now to seize this opportunity. Embrace inscriptions, explore their boundless potential, and unleash your ingenuity to shape the future of the internet. Join the ranks of those who are pioneering this new era of digital innovation, and leave an indelible mark on the landscape of technology.",
