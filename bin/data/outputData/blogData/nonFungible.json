    "time": "April 15, 2022",
    "content": "What is Voxies?\nBeyond appearance, Voxies have different classes and races as in an MMORPG, these are distinguished by several advantages on the field and will define the role of Voxies in the game.\nAt present Voxies are used in the game mode Voxie Tactics, currently in beta. Each Voxie is a unique combination of different attributes with different levels of rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary to Devine.\nIn fact, each Voxie has 20 attributes in addition to a class and race! Players equip their heroes with items and accessories to help them on the Voxie Tactics battlefield.\nVoxies’ Classes are divided into two groups: Attackers and Supporters. These classes are further subdivided into subcategories such as Tank and DPS. Note that the Voxie class is not definitive and can be changed under certain conditions.\nVoxies are also customizable with weapons, armor and other items, apart from the standard Voxies. This is a strong incentive for people to rent Voxies, whether to fight in the open PvP league or to farm with a better RNG rate and loot.\nWhat is the Voxies’ gameplay?\nVoxie is based on exploration gameplay in a dynamic world where you can interact with non-playable characters, complete quests and buy equipment.\nExploration is punctuated by arena battles against other players (PvP) or the environment (PvE) at the end of which rewards are distributed in the form of VOXEL and NFTs. Indeed, you can earn new weapons, equipment and even pets while playing.\nIn battle, Voxies have MPs (Movement Points) that are used for all actions in the game. Characters take turns performing actions. The player with the last character or characters still standing wins the game.\nHow to play Voxie?\nTo play, players will need to follow several steps:\nBuying a Voxies allows you to get Voxel tokens and to have an advantage in your progression through the game. However, having a Voxie NFT is not mandatory to be able to play and win rewards. Indeed, the game provides characters by default in a free-to-play mode.\nPlayers then collect and assemble Voxies, mixing the different types to form their ideal group of Voxies.\nPlayers can currently play in the Voxie Tactics mode to compete against other Voxies and earn rewards.\nEvery character can be leveled up, potentially unlocking more powers and features. Players can direct their character to conduct an action, equip an item, move around the map, or simply wait their turn.\nItems such as guns and shields can improve a character’s abilities by providing greater power or armor. Players can set their characters on the map before a battle begins. As a result, melee and tank characters can prevent foes from reaching long-range attacks, for example.\nTokenomics of Voxies\nThe VOXEL token is the token of the game and will be used for all activities, such as purchasing new weapons, armor or items to use in the game.\nIn the game, the VOXEL can be acquired by playing and completing various objectives, for example after each battle depending on the outcome of the battle. The exploration mode will also allow you to “discover” and collect VOXEL tokens.\nClasses and rarities\nThere are different classes of Voxies that are available to players. In terms of rarity, it goes like this. The game offers 10 different character races and 20 unique classes, each with its own powers and abilities:\nPirate – Samurai – Chemist – Timemage – Hawkknight – Thief – Monk – Druid – Bard – Ninja – Knight – Ranger – Necromancer – Warrior – Black mage – Priest – White Mage – Robo – Squire – Monster.\nIn terms of price, these classes of Voxies can be defined by their categories:\nThe races in the game include Human, Doge, Fox, Zombie, Robot, Alien, Skeleton, Dragon, and Red Robot. Active and passive abilities are available to each race. Particular races are better suited to certain classes; for example, a fox has added dexterity as a passive skill and would be more suited to a class with dexterity as its major stat. These new abilities provide another layer to combat and team selection, boosting the variety and possibilities of builds.\nConclusion\nEven if Voxies Tactics is still in beta, the gameplay is still surprisingly good. The team is quite active and releases patches regularly. In other news, the parent company, Alway Geeky Games, also received a $1.1 million investment from Binance Labs in early March.\nVoxie Tactics launched its Open Beta in March. The game already offers rewards for winning battles: VOXEL tokens and NFTs. It’s hard to find games in beta that offer such kinds of things. So, access to the game is free, don’t hesitate to take a look and go try the game if you like the concept!\nThe VOXEL token is available on the Binance exchange and is currently trading at $1.6.\n",

    "title": "The History of NFTs on Ethereum",
    "time": "April 12, 2022",
    "content": "What is an NFT? The definition of an NFT is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. NFTs range from works of fine art to real estate with new advancements and projects created every day. While NFTs are still a relatively new technology, they have a rich and detailed history that we will be exploring today in detail.\nPinpointing exactly what year NFTs were first developed is a subject that is up for debate. In order to approach the topic as thoroughly as possible, we will be addressing a handful of projects that are believed to be the first NFTs. We will also explain the reasons why they were created. This article focuses on NFTs minted on Ethereum, so there are some early projects that will not be discussed in this article.\n2015 – Terra Nullius\nAccording to research done by Adam McBride, Terra Nullius was the first NFT on ETH. Defined as land that is legally deemed to be unoccupied or uninhabited, Terra Nullius created a new frontier for investors. First minted on August 7, 2015, Terra Nullius is a project designed to allow users to “Stake a claim on the blockchain”.\nPre-dating most established NFTs by two years, this is the first product that is considered a true NFT. While most major NFTs today mint thousands of their products, Terra Nullius flew under the radar with only 22 minted at the initial launch. To date, the dev team has minted an additional 25, leaving their total at only 47.\nDue to their relatively limited launch in comparison to some of the larger projects that marked 2017, it is easy to see why Terra Nullius was overlooked for so long. In fact, the devs responsible for Terra Nullius did not refer to their creation as an NFT. Instead, they simply identified it as an “interactive Ethereum Contract”.\nMarch 2017 — Rare Pepe on Ethereum\nWhile the first Rare Pepe NFTs were launched in October of 2016, they weren’t traded on ETH until 2017. Titled Peperium, the project was designed to allow meme trading on the blockchain.\nWith such a strong cult following surrounding Pepe the Frog and the meme culture that surrounds crypto, it made sense that it was one of the first established NFT projects that transferred over to Ethereum. With a strong community that exists to this day, Peperium serves as an example of how NFTs have largely become community-based projects.\nJune 2017 — CryptoPunks\nIn 2017, Developers John Watkinson and Matt Hall launched CryptoPunks and forever changed the NFT world. CyptoPunks started as a collection of 10,000 randomly generated characters that were each uniquely different. They might not have been the first NFTs to be minted, but they were the first NFT project that went mainstream and began to pull in a more varied group of people into the NFT space. Not only that, but CryptoPunks was the inspiration for the ERC-721 Standard that a majority of NFTs use to this day.\nWith the current lowest bid for a CryptoPunk sitting at 66.5ETH (Currently about 215,536.47 USD), CryptoPunks is easily one of the most profitable NFT collections to date. Matt and John’s success was one of the driving factors for the expansion of the NFT market.\nNew investors, encouraged by their success, began to produce and trade their own NFTs in hopes of seeing even a fraction of the success that they saw. In addition to new entrepreneurs, celebrities joined the bandwagon and began to invest with CryptoPunks.\nSerena Williams, Snoop Dogg, Steve Aoki, and Odell Becham Jr. are just a handful of the celebrities that are currently invested in CryptoPunks.\n2018-2020 – The NFT Renaissance\n2018 marked the start of the NFT Boom. Not only was the marketplace beginning to take shape on sites like OpenSea, but NFTs began to enter the real world for the first time. 2018 was known as the year of acceptance for the Non-Fungible Token. Moving into the mainstream, NFTs were able to gain more acceptance by those outside of the traditional ‘Tech Bro’ sphere.\nIn January 2018, the Rare Digital Art Festival hosted an NFT-focused gathering for collectors to explore and bid on popular pieces. On February 12th, NonFungible.com launched the first NFT Yearly Report tracking trends on the Ethereum chain. This was the first time ETH-based NFTs and cryptocurrencies received a defining, comprehensive market review.\nMoving into 2019, Web3 wallets like Metamask became more accessible and widely utilized by the community. NFT-based games and collectibles began to rise in popularity allowing for the gaming community and NFT community to merge. Previously, games such as Etheria (2015) and CryptoKitties (2017), while popular, were not joined by other game developers until the NFT boom of 2018-2020.\n2020 marked a continuation of NFT growth. Major news networks began to pick up on stories related to NFTs and the general population was exposed to them for the first time. Rarible, a decentralized exchange for NFTs, launched with great success, even though it had some issues relating to washtrading. In addition, fractionalized NFTs, the division of larger NFTs into more affordable segments began to be popularized and allowed for a larger number of individuals to own previously sold out or unaffordable projects.\nWith an explosion of NFTs and a surge of new buyers fueling the market, the NFT community saw record profits and a flood of new artists entering the field. This boom lasted well through 2020 and only began to stabilize during 2021.\n2021 – The Year of Representation\nOne of the biggest and most exciting developments of 2021 was the launch of the first-ever female-run NFT projects. The discovery that Fame Lady Squad, a project that had previously held the status as the first female-run NFT project turned out to be operated by Russian men. This opened up a spirited discussion about the lack of female representation in the NFT space and put a fire under those who were eager to make changes.\nDetermined to increase the presence of women in the Web3 space, World of Women stepped up with a project that was designed by and for women. This time for real. Created by Yam Karkai, World of Women was created to ensure that women of all backgrounds were represented, sometimes for the first time, in the NFT space. Celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon and Eva Longoria were quick to jump onto the project, showing their support of female artists in a previously male-dominated space.\nWorld of Women was not the only female-run NFT project to launch in 2021. Boss Beauties, founded by feminist and artist Lisa Mayer, broke away from the traditional strategy of NFT artists maintaining their anonymity and began to use NFTs as a means of empowering women around the world.\n2021 truly was the year of female representation, but it was also a year of representation for other marginalized groups.\nQueenly NFT, “an NFT cryptogallery for queer creators” launched in April of 2021. Marking the first marketplace entirely focused on hosting, marketing, and launching LGBTQ+ run projects. Founded by Drag Queen Ruby Powers, this marketplace is the first of its kind and has already helped a dozen LGBTQ+ artists launch their NFTs.\nArtist Nicole Yap, disheartened by the male-dominated NFT space and fueled by her desire to reconnect with her cultural roots and preserve it for generations to come, created 8SIAN, an NFT that celebrated Asian women as well as their art and culture.\nIn February 2021, Iris Nevins founded Umba Daima, an NFT studio designed to strengthen and diversify the Web3 Ecosystem. Nevins believes that the NFT space will help her to “ensure Black artists can gain visibility and generate wealth”. You can read more about her work here.\nAll of these projects launched in 2021, and though they hardly include all projects that launched during the year, they represent the influx of new faces joining the NFT community and working to transform it into something new, vibrant, and diverse.\n2022 and Beyond: Where Are We Heading?\n2021 showed stabilization in the markets and a more consistent level of growth within the industry, which is in stark contrast to the relatively unpredictable growth between 2018-2020. It may be reasonable to assume that the markets have moved out of the “Gold Rush” stage of its development.\nThis does not mean that the markets have completely stabilized. It is safe to assume that there will continue to be spikes and valleys as the relatively new industry works out remaining growing pains and continues to regulate. Though, we can assume that they will not be as dramatic as they have been in the past.\nGrowing pressures from world governments to regulate the markets produce a lot of unknowns. New regulations and laws surrounding the industry will more likely than not lead to more measured sales and purchases. Such developments could slow the market, but will ultimately lend more credibility and security overall.\nBy implementing laws and fail-safes, there will be fewer opportunities for less scrupulous individuals to commit fraud utilizing the blockchain and will hopefully create a contingency if those incidents occur.\nThe Changing Face of NFTs\nWith NFTs being known as a mostly male-dominated industry, it is encouraging to see a broader range of artists, entrepreneurs, and developers enter the field. Seeing oneself represented in an industry is crucial to fostering creativity and growth in any sector. The public face of NFTs is one that is focused on social and environmental change rather than being a purely tech-based industry.\nRecently, attention has been brought to previous practices that made NFTs environmentally unfriendly. With a high carbon footprint, NFTs were utilizing processes that created large amounts of carbon and did little to offset that damage. Recently, carbon-neutral processes have been developed that ensure that NFTs are more environmentally conscious.\nWith a new focus on ensuring NFTs are environmentally friendly, the future of NFTs could easily be a green one.\n",

    "title": "Metaverse and Casinos: Rolling the NFT Dice",
    "time": "August 30, 2022",
    "content": "Humans have been playing gambling since at least 5000 BC when sheep knucklebones were used as dice by the Sumarians in ancient Mesopotamia, with the first familiar six sided dice discovered in Iraq and Iran around 3000 BC.\nFrom those early times we have endlessly looked for new ways to gamble in spite of any prohibitions. Today, this tendency has been propelled into hyper speed by the impetus of new technologies, with NFTs being the new frontier. The data proves the pattern: in 2021 the market size of the global online gambling and betting industry was $61.5B USD. According to Statista, that market will grow to $114.4B USD by 2028 for an increase of more than 86 percent.\nWhen we see that Sorare, an NFT fantasy football game platform, raised $680 million USD in a Series B funding round, it’s clear that non-fungible tokens will be part of that growth.\nSports Betting\nParis-based Sorare presents an NFT-driven sports card platform where baseball and football fans can build teams from the NFT cards they’ve collected. The first cards were minted on the Ethereum blockchain. Today, they use a Starkware sidechain to reduce the transaction fees and scale the possibilities of the game. A player’s teams can in turn be entered into fantasy competitions that provide rewards paid out in ETH.\nUnfortunately for the brand, Sorare has run afoul of regulators in Great Britain who claim that the business’ operations are unlicensed and constitute unregulated gambling. Since the UK Gambling Commission’s initial statement in October of 2021, there have been no new announcements from the regulator. Sorare disputes the UK regulator’s claims. To a casual reader, it may seem like the Gambling Commission is over-reacting. However, Sorare has most of the world’s top 100 soccer teams under contract and has sold over $130M in the space in 2021 which would seem to indicate otherwise.\nWe want to make a distinction here that may be evident to those more experienced in the realm of blockchain: NFTs and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing. Therefore, receiving payment in the form of ETH is often very different from receiving an NFT. In brief, and this may be disputed by some in the crypto community, cryptocurrency can be considered a security as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines the term.\nThis is because cryptocurrency is a means to hold, gain, or transfer an investment. NFTs, on the other hand, can simply offer utility or be collectible. Without the indication of a return on investment for a common purpose (see the Howey test for assets) it can be more difficult to decide whether an NFT is an asset for legal reasons.\nAccordingly, we recommend that readers consult our services to help understand their NFT portfolios better.\nMetaverse Casinos Controversies\nWhile fun for some folks, casinos have historically been associated with a variety of illegal activities. That trend has manifested in new ways thanks to Flamingo Casino Club and Sand Vegas Casino. Each project represents much of what can go awry in tech-forward, online ventures. These two instances exemplify the need to understand the fundamentals of the crypto and NFT space before investing.\nFlamingo Casino Club does not exist in the metaverse or real world. There is no connection between it and the Flamingo Casino in Las Vegas, as the project claims. It is, according to regulators from the states of Texas, Wisconsin, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Alabama, a scam. The owners provide no information as to their location or identities and the digital trail leads back to an IP in Russia, which regulators say lowers the chance that investors can recover their funds significantly.\nThe Sand Vegas Casino, apparently based in Cyprus, has angered regulators in Texas which is quite an achievement! The state alleges that this casino has traded in unregulated securities. This is because the club forecasted profit-sharing from its Gambling Apes NFT collection. As a precaution, OpenSea halted trading of the NFTs in the Spring of 2022.\nLegitimate Use Cases for Legitimate Casinos\nReal-world casinos have been earlier adopters of tech such as facial recognition and big data. These technologies allow them to better serve customers, limit fraud, and respect folks who’ve banned themselves from establishment premises. NFTs might be the next complementary items bestowed on VIPs and even casual visitors. The prospect of winning a $200,000 Ape might keep even your modest player at the table a bit longer. Likewise, NFTs could serve a valuable role in the secondary ticketing market as we’ve discussed in another article. In fact, it’s surprising that casinos have yet to collect royalties on tickets thanks to the smart contract functionalities of non-fungible tokens: if they loved the money from the first time a ticket sold, why not the second or third?\nWhile it’s hard to gauge the legitimacy of a metaverse casino across all the jurisdictions where one can be accessed, the ICE Poker virtual casino in Decentraland seems like a popular operation if nothing else. Thousands of visitors play poker daily in the casino run by Decentral Games, even accounting for 30% of Decentraland’s daily users according to Markets Insider\nZed Run is a popular NFT game on the Matic network. Like the cryptokitties of yore with more gaming potential and interaction, the horses in NFT form each possess their own DNA. This DNA gives them their distinct value for the sake of racing and breeding. Their low floor price combined with the low entry cost for most races makes this project a viable entry point for learning about NFTs via participation.\nThe Next Roll of the Dice\nLooking for more use cases? We’ve got your back at our NFT Academy. And for our readers who enjoy a flutter, what do you see coming up next in NFT gambling?\n",

    "time": "May 18, 2021",
    "content": "Over the past year DeFi has been developing at a rapid pace, but its spread into the world of NFTs as a viable option for traders and finance has been slower. NFTs provide an ability to wrap tokens and value and provide a viable container that can prove very useful.\nHowever the merging of its visual abilities plus these DeFi centric skill sets have been limited. Even less can be found utilizing the multi power of Semi Fungible Tokens which can be both unique art and fungible value, until now.\nGetting to grips with DeFi can be complicated for anybody who hasn’t mastered the technical and financial aspects related to the blockchain. Even casual investors with over 6 months experience can still find some aspects confusing.\nBut some experienced traders have learned how to leverage these aspects and are always looking for new tools to put together the most effective trading strategies and profit making. Perhaps the most successful use cases of NFTs in DeFi will reveal themselves from this hybrid community?\nThis is what The Wolves of Wall Street is betting on by focusing more specifically on Semi-Fungible Tokens which provide the ability to add a fun visual characterisation to ease entry level investors into the DeFi space as well as the innovation to attract hardcore DeFi traders and investors.\nC-Folios and Semi Fungible Tokens\nThe use of SFTs within the WOWS ecosystem is centred around their CryptoFolios or C-Folios™ and are visualised as Liquidity Pool Trader Wolves or the Stablecoin Business Bois (aka dogs).\nThe LP Wolf traders are eager for a quick profit and only want one thing: to make money, whatever the cost, but they are also the main token holders and support the growth of the token.\nThe second group, the Business Bois (dogs), consists of stablecoin farmers. They create the Total Value Locked of invested stablecoin, a key metric in DeFi, and are long term players, but are also accused by token holders of not contributing enough to the tokens health, having only to invest in stablecoins with minimal token buy in.\nIn this way, WOWS visualizes the opposing pillars of AMM and lending with 2 factions cut from the same cloth Wolves and Bois and reveal their dynamics within DeFi for a wider audience.\nHaving your own C-Folios™ , the token that acts as a portfolio for your LP and stablecoin investments has multiple advantages.\nAll annual earnings, collectables and LP values can go into your own unique SFT C-Folios™. Everything in that C-Folios™ can be managed by you, whether you take your rewards out or you take your investment NFTS out, each element can be sold separately OR together by you as a user at any time.\nThe next user of your C-Folios™ can then have all your collectables, rewards and value and use it again as they wish on the WOWS platform.\nOther more serious future financial applications can be found such as the CRO (Collateralised Rewards Obligation) a new term created by the WOWS team and made possible by using the SFTs.\nThis involves the ability to collect multiple stacked LP investment NFTs with a high risk but high rewards percentage and stable coin investments NFTs with a low risk (and slightly lower rewards percentage) – and spread a ratio of risk in one financial vehicle so there is more chance of higher profits since there is also a bigger buffer that serves as collateral.\nThis possibility of new ways to utilize SFTs in the financial sector has caught the attention of some influential people in the Financial sector namely Massimo Buonomo the Former UN Global expert in BlockchAIot, blockchain and a current advisor and consultant for international organizations, central banks and corporates, as well as financial institutions in Dubai.\nOther future use cases, already in the roadmap beyond the Lp staking and stable lending investment NFTs are clear:\nUpcoming news and events for WOWS.\nThe team are currently building up to their imminent launch of their stablecoin and LP staking C-folio dApp where the core features of the C-Folio will be revealed. The 2nd batch of 280 new C-Folios are available for purchase.\nAs the first pre-sale sold out very quickly, it is important to remind those who are interested that it is necessary to pay in $WOWS to get in.\nTo add a layer of security upstream, The Wolves of Wall Street made a partnership with COVER recently in order to be able to ensure the investments. Other partnerships are in the pipeline but it will be necessary to watch out for official announcements from the team.\nThe team have also announced a very important strategic partnership with NFY.finance and their owners MIMIR CORPORATION. MIMIR is fast positioning itself as a major player in the DeFi and blockchain scene, having just been announced as an official collaborative partner of the Geometric Space Corp and now infamous Dogecoin Cubesat Space X Launch in July 2022.\nWOWS \u0026 NFY will actively cross collaborate on new projects under the MIMIR brand. Cyotee and MIMIR Devs will help push through certain new features on the WOWS platform, whilst also working together with the WOWS team to create a shared token pool and other unique C-Folios will be created to represent the new team members of MIMIR.\nAnd of course the biggest event after the platform launch is the World’s First Global DeFi Summit in Dubai on the 2-3rd of June, where the founders of WOWS tristan and Mateen will be presenting WOWS to affluent investors and mixing and meeting with many of the leaders in the blockchain sector.\nThe Team Presentation\nAppearing in late 2020, The Wolves of Wall Street team does not hide behind anonymity and makes themselves known from the first article on their Medium page:\nProud of their skill set and respective experiences, The Wolves of Wall Street puts themselves forward to show that “they have nothing to hide” in a Universe where the risks are very numerous.\nDeFI is an extremely young environment and that is why the team wants to be reassuring and authentic about themselves and the implementation and security of their project.\nA powerful DeFi tool\nAlthough it is mainly the NFT art sector that has been talked about since the beginning of the year, this use of semi-fungible tokens in such an innovative way is particularly interesting for all who operate in the Decentralized Finance sector.\nBy specializing in DeFI to offer increasingly powerful tools, The Wolves of Wall Street have managed to create a very powerful financial project in record time. Indeed, as we said above, such intensive use of Decentralized Finance is still very young in the crypto ecosystem, which tends to make investors wary.\nBut the Wolves of Wall Street are reaching out directly to experts to make it easier for traders to do create new opportunities in DeFi and for beginner investors, a visually led fun interactive process to make their first steps.\nIt will be necessary to observe the results of various C-folios to form an opinion on their effectiveness and to make a choice according to their chosen strategy!\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "time": "August 02, 2022",
    "content": "This article is designed to educate individuals on the different ways the LGBTQ+ community has established and grown in the NFT space. Keep in mind that while we did include quite a few LGBTQ+ projects on this list, there are still plenty out there for you to explore and discover on your own!\nCoca-Cola Pride\nLaunched on June 30th, 2022, Coca-Cola released its Pride Series! A collection of 136 NFTs consisting of brightly colored rainbow versions of the company’s iconic glass bottles that were put up for auction and hosted on Polygon.\nA fun and colorful way to celebrate Pride, the collection was created by award-winning designer and LGBTQ+ advocate Rich Minsi. Profits earned from the sale went directly to LGBTQ+ charities. While the sale only brought in $23,000 initially, a percentage of all future sales will be going to charity as well.\nThe Decentraland Meta Pride Festival\nBig companies weren’t the only ones to get into the spirit of Pride. Decentraland hosted their own pride event that lasted for the whole of July. DCL’s Festival Land District was transformed into a fully fledged Pride Parade complete with rainbow fountains, interactive pride floats, and plenty of areas for attendees to take selfies. The event promoted live performances and also offered free wearables to visitors.\nFashion brands such as Original Penguin, popstar Thalia, guests and Web3 community members joined the festivities as speakers and entertainers. Attendees were invited to interact with the floats, join panels, parties, and more. In addition to events on the main festival grounds, teleporters were available sporadically across that allowed visitors to visit other locations holding events in Decentraland.\nBetween the booths, performances, and speakers, the event was designed to mimic a real-world Pride festival and provided opportunities for individuals who might not otherwise get the chance to attend or experience what Pride is all about.\nThe MetaPride Festival was described by its hosts as ‘the start of a modern movement’ The event was brought to life by Jake Resnico an event coordinator with experience bringing to life exciting festivals around the world, and Matt Stevenson, who previously worked for both Time and Wired. The event was meant to combine live entertainment with NFTs, bringing Christopher Street into the Metaverse.\nThe event was meant to act as a celebration of love and included live musical performances alongside moving speeches by empowering speakers. Special guests included Galantis, LP Giobbi, Ty Sunderland, and Blondish, among many others.\nIn addition to live entertainment, the event also hosted an NFT Charity Collection composed of unique creations designed by LGBTQ+ creators that were then auctioned off. All proceeds were donated to OutRight Action International, which works to support global LGBTQ+ communities.\nThe Queenly NFT\nMoving away from events and projects designed solely to take place during Pride Month, let’s take a moment to explore a project meant to support and promote queer creators year-round. Founded by NYC drag queen Ruby Powers (aka Brent Lomas), The Queenly NFT is an organization used to promote, host, and support LGBTQ+ creators who are entering the Metaverse.\nSo The Queenly NFT, LLC has helped over a dozen queer creators to launch their projects successfully. These projects include work by several artists of varying backgrounds, gender, and sexual orientations. With the Metaverse still such a new environment for most, the importance of amplifying the voices of queer creators is more important than ever.\nTheir most recent project, ‘Dissolve’ by Grey Leifer is a collection of 12 animations featuring specially designed soundscapes. Leifer commented on their project, stating that “Each piece is a [study] of emotional resolve, a commentary on internal ebb and flow. These are universal experiences for people who walk through society ‘othered.’”\nLeifer is an established fine artist and worked previously as Chief Design Officer for the gender-equal clothing brand, Play Out Apparel.\nPride Icons\nPride Icons is a limited digital collection of pop art NFTs, created by Max Bahman. The collection itself consists of three sets that are ‘fabulous, legendary, and unique in their own way.’ Purchase of the Pride Icon NFTs grants users access to a community as well as member-only benefits and events. In addition to benefits in the metaverse, members are also given benefits that include discounts on facial plastic surgeries and discount memberships to a partnered fitness resort.\nCo-Founders Eliad Cohen, Regev Gur, and Amir Lazarovich hoped to create a ‘purpose-led community’ that worked to fund non-profit organizations while creating a supportive environment for members of the LGBTQ+ Community. Though currently in a ‘hybernation period’, the group insists that there are big plans to come for the community.\nCurrently, the project has not yet been launched: The creators had originally planned to launch on June 1st, 2022, during Pride Month but unfortunately could not do so.\nFeWoCiOUS\nFeWoCiOUS is a collection of NFTs created by a young transgender artist who goes by the name of Victor, and has earned over $17 million in under a year. Originally utilized as a way to escape from his day-to-day life, the artist has now created a mini-empire by selling his pieces in the metaverse.\nHis most recent project, FeWoWorld, will allow holders of paint drops to unlock items in the generative art world he has created. He explains that the ‘more paint in your “Paint Drop” the more you’ll be able to unlock in FewoWorld.’ This includes canvas and items he calls Fewos. Fewos are inhabitants of FeWoWorld, and are another collectible for investors in the projects.\nTake Up Space\nTake Up Space is a Web3 Playbook created by Founders Paff Evara and Hannah Peacock. It is designed to give new investors the skills to navigate the Web3 space with confidence while providing an understanding and supportive community. After feeling irritated by how ‘pale, male and pretty stale’ they found the metaverse, they decided to bring in some changes to make the community more accessible to a broader range of individuals.\nThe pair explained that their primary goal is to bring more BIPOC \u0026 LGBTQ+ people into the metaverse and create a welcoming space from the start. They have created a course that is designed with walk-throughs, readings, webinars and Q\u0026As while also providing support 24/7 on their Discord. Their goal is to break Web3 down in to its smallest segments to help boost anyone’s knowledge from complete beginners to intermediate users who are just looking for a bit more information.\nWeb3 and Inclusivity Continue to Grow\nIt’s great to see these positive moves by companies who are bringing LGBTQ+ into the NFT space in such diverse ways.\nAll of these projects are working to ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals have an active voice in Web3 from the very beginning. This list was intended to introduce you to ways you too can get involved and support the community!\nAs always, make sure to research any project before you invest to ensure you are actually supporting LGBTQ+ creations that do support worthy causes and charities. As inclusivity and Web3 continue to grow together we are excited to see what comes next in this area of Web3!\n",

    "title": "Short Analysis of Decentraland’s Uprising Economy",
    "time": "April 14, 2018",
    "content": "In 2018, I learned about the Decentraland project and the notion of creating a virtual reality Metaverse on the Ethereum blockchain. If you are unaware of what Decentraland is, check out their whitepaper and this article.\nSafe to say, I am amazed by Decentraland and, in particular, the LAND market. Decentraland LANDs are non-fungible, ERC-721 tokens that can be purchased, sold and traded on the Decentraland Marketplace. As a ‘numbers guy’, I am fascinated by the Marketplace that the Decentraland team has created.\nHow to Value LANDs\nJust like real estate, the key to valuing Decentraland LAND is based on 3 words you’ve probably heard before: location, location, location! People are scrambling to figure out how to place a price on their land. Here are the trends I am noticing:\n1. Proximity to road\nIs the LAND connected to a road or not? There are tons of questions that need to be answered here. Will there be access to parcels that are not attached to roads? Realistically, 90% of parcels would be inaccessible if you could only access roadside parcels.\n2. Distance from the center\nThe closer you are to parcel coordinates 0,0 the more valuable your land is! As of now, the Central Plaza will be the only spawning location.\n3. Proximity to districts\nPeople are banking on districts generating foot traffic. The more popular the district is, the more people will go to your land!\n4. Detached LANDs\nIf your land is not attached to a road, it probably isn’t valued as much as the roadside!\nThis list is not exhaustive. As the platform continues to grow, we will see new value indicators emerge and will add them to this list.\nIntroduction of Marketplace \u0026 Variable Prices\nWhat is Value? How does a person value a parcel of land that you cannot build on yet? These are questions that the Decentraland community members are asking themselves since the introduction of the Land Marketplace on March 23rd, 2018. The Land Marketplace has given the community the first chance for people to offer their parcels of land that they “won” in the Terraform Auction which started on December 15th.\nSince the Land Marketplace was introduced to the community, there has been a wide variety of asking prices that people are demanding. The asking prices have ranged from 950 MANA to 10+ million MANA (convert MANA to any currency here). There is no rhyme or reason why people are valuing parcels at the prices that they’re going for. The only possible economic answer as to why prices are what they are is one that people who invest in cryptocurrencies understand very well:\n“The value of any asset is only defined by the value buyers are willing to give to it.”\nAs long as people continue to buy Decentraland LANDs, we will start to gauge what the true value is of the land. At the end of the day, the value of LAND will be determined by the buyers. As long as people continue to purchase LANDs, the community will get more data on what the value is of Decentraland LANDs.\nLet’s Talk Numbers\nUsing data from NonFungible.com, we calculated the actual LAND value of different areas of Decentraland’s Genesis City map. NonFungible.com has the entire history of the 35,000+ LAND transactions that have occurred since Decentraland’s inception.\nIn order to make a practical and usable map that makes sense from a macro value perspective, we subdivided the Genesis City map into 18 “value zones.” For our map, we focused on the following value indicators.\nOur Findings\nFinally, I want to thank @dafky2000 (NonFungible.com CEO). His hard work and dedication to the non-fungible space have made all of this possible.\nSpecial thanks also go to Ethen Ostroff (@Ethen.O) for his great review and help with this article.\nMore articles to come on other Crypto Collectibles! Stay tuned!\n",

Now they’re fusing together the fast-pace, exciting worlds of nightclubs and NFTs with their own collection “11 Captain’s Club” based on their iconic E11even Caps.\nBehind the Scenes of E11even Crypto\nSince April 2021 E11even has been a big player in the crypto space. They broke into the scene as the first club to accept $APE as a means of payment. Now they’ve partnered with Horizen Labs to publish a collection of NFT hats in its usual striking, provocative style. Here’s a look into the core team for the project:\nWith these veterans of the entertainment industry and the advice of Horizen Labs, The 11 Captain’s Club is offering an experience combining digital swag with a real world advantage incomparable to any NFT project that’s come before it.\nThe 11 Captain’s Club\nThey chose caps because of the simple fact: celebrities around the world wear them. All of them are unique and represent the one who wears it.\nThere are 1,111 CAP NFTs in the collection, all of which are randomly generated during the mint from over 110 different traits in 8 categories. Some of the more exciting traits you’ll see are the actual hat material, accessories, logos, shades, and of course nightclub effects in the background.\nWe know, it’s 2022, and profile pic NFTs are dead, so let’s get into the most important part – the utility of owning one of only 1,111 caps.\nTo buy the NFT and be part of the club, you do have to be at least 21 years old.\nE11even Crypto Mint information\nThe mint will be opened for the Allow list on May 24, 2022 directly on the website of 11 Captain’s Club. The collection will be open to the public at 11:00AM ET on May 25, 2022. The cost of the mint is 3 ETH.

    "content": "Just as the art world has wrapped its mind around the idea of using digital as one of its mediums, technological progress has leaped much further – all the way into multiverse events. As much as it can be unsettling, it is also an unprecedented opportunity.\nIn March 2021, Decentraland hosted the first metaverse fashion week which allowed for “everyone from anywhere” to attend, instead of a selected few plucked from the traditional fashion scene. Even Doctor Strange is having his next adventure in – yes you guessed right – the multiverse!\nWhat is .ART Digital Twin?\nIn the metaverse, you need an avatar to represent you – an online character that will either mimic your physical characteristics or take on a completely different form. Your artwork needs a metaverse projection too – a so-called “digital twin”. Back in 2019 .ART Domains presented its Digital Twin product at Apsara Conference, organized annually by the Alibaba Group.\nWith .ART Digital Twin you can create a secure digital certificate of authenticity for your artwork and store information about it. You can also monetize it by using a built-in, no-coding NFT minting solution. Leveraging the easy-to-understand technology of domain names and using an international standard for describing cultural objects developed by J. Paul Getty Trust, Digital Twin by .ART provides a sophisticated but intuitive art object identification tool.\nAs the product is currently being tailored towards the needs of the creative community, .ART presents a unique opportunity for artists submitting their entries for Roborace to be a part of the future and influence Digital Twin’s further development.\nThis comes as the global AR, VR, and MR market is projected to reach $300 billion by the end of 2024. With all this in mind it still must be noted: it’s up to us as individuals to build up the metaverse and make sure that the world of “beyond” has a fair representation of creativity, beauty, and art in it.\nThe 24 days of l’.ART\nNext up are racing events. Roborace, the world’s first extreme competition of teams developing self-driving AI, will be hosting twelve races over six events this summer in a mixed reality environment that blends elements of the virtual and physical worlds for teams and fans alike.\n.ART, the growing domain for creatives that sees its mission in facilitating the interaction between art, tech and finance, has partnered with Roborace as well as Wakatta, the first NFT-focused blockchain for entertainment and Sensorium, the company behind one of the world’s leading entertainment metaverses. As the line between real and digital continues to blur, they created an opportunity for digital artists to spearhead their creative transition into the metaverse – The 24 Days Of L’ .ART\nInspired by the 24 Hours of Le Mans, The 24 Days Of L’.ART is an international art competition and an opportunity for 3D artists worldwide to exhibit their talents at Roborace. Roborace is a racing metaverse that combines the excitement of physical racing with artificial intelligence and augmented reality to take motorsports to the next level.\n“.ART has always been at the forefront of innovation, especially when it comes to bringing the benefits of tech and finance to the art world. The 24 Days Of L’.ART is a collaboration that does exactly that – allows artists to take their creations beyond the physical realm into the metaverse, where the aren’t any borders and, more importantly, no barriers for freedom of creative expression. We hope that Digital Twin by .ART will serve well in its role of an informational container, allowing artworks to be represented in the metaverse with all the context that makes up their value”\nRoborace is an AR-enhanced race\nRoborace’s electric and fully autonomous racing cars will compete in real-world tracks, with added challenges straight from the metaverse. Augmented reality objects scattered around the tracks will magnify the difficulty and dangers of these races, but also heighten the level of entertainment delivered to fans.\nThe 24 Days Of L’.ART is a competition where artists can submit their original 3D artworks to be used as obstacles in a Roborace AR-enhanced race. Artists will also gain exposure by joining the live broadcast of the race, and getting a chance to shed light on the inspiration behind their creations. It is a unique opportunity for creators to embrace the possibilities of the metaverse, diversify their artistic process and take part in defining the future of art.\nThere are three steps in the application process:\nAll the information, guidelines and application form can be found at 24days.art Submission deadline is May 31st, 2022.\nSubmit your art to The 24 Days Of L’.ART now and make sure it launches with your artwork as one of its main attractions!\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "time": "April 18, 2022",
    "content": "There is little doubt that when it comes to Crypto and especially NFTs, cybersecurity is an essential element.\nYet sadly due to many companies wanting to quickly onboard many newcomers to their ecosystem, the security aspect is often sacrificed. The various browser wallets like Metamask are indeed very convenient to use but they also have a major flaw: private keys are stored directly in the browser.\nThe IsoWallet team has created an innovative solution to overcome this problem.\nPresentation of IsoWallet\nIsoWallet is made up of a team with varying backgrounds but with a focus on blockchain and cybersecurity. Here are the core team members:\nIsoWallet is an innovative solution to manage the security of its users’ crypto assets and the team aims to solve several key security flaws that currently plague the crypto wallet ecosystem.\nOne of IsoWallet’s primary goals is to protect users against phishing attacks. Phishing and spear phishing attacks are two of the main attack vectors that face crypto wallets today. Ultimately, IsoWallet dreams to make security accessible without abandoning the wallet’s ease of use.\nBy creating and storing the private keys in a Zero-Knowledge environment, the team will never have access to the various different private keys, IsoWallet users will forever be in charge.\nOther advantages for IsoWallet include Multi-Chain and Layer-2 compatibility, trustless transactions, access to your favorite decentralized exchanges in-app or even an extensive education materials to help you navigate Web3.\nThe IsoWallet NFT drop: IsoBots\nIn order to develop a community invested in the project, Isowallet will carry out a drop of 5,555 NFTs dedicated to crypto values: IsoBots.\nThe central idea of this collection is to highlight the right to privacy but also the right to have sufficient security. IsoBots take up the different values of the crypto ecosystem in general. Owning it will therefore make it possible on the one hand to be part of the IsoWallet community but also to promote healthy values of the ecosystem.\nThe blockchain that will be used for the drop is Ethereum and to discover the date of the drop and be whitelisted, first you will have to go to IsoWallet’s Discord.\nThe artist who made the different features of the drop is Andrea Ranaldo AKA “Crazer”, a 3D artist with more than a decade of experience. It is important to remember that having this NFT will also give access to exclusive features.\nEach NFT will provide early access, and access to beta testing for the yet to be developed blockchain wallet by IsoWallet. NFT holders will also receive access to exclusive educational resources on Web3 and security, as well as a private Discord with the IsoWallet team.\nAdditionally, all IsoBot NFT holders will have 0 fees for swapping (MetaMask charges 0.8% on internal wallet swaps).\nWhat are the next steps?\nAlthough the date of the drop of the Isobots has not yet been announced, it is possible to consult the roadmap of IsoWallet directly on their Whitepaper.\nThe following phases of the roadmap include the wallet’s official launch and of the integration of trustless transaction features. The development will continue according to the feedback of the users as well as the beginning of a creation for the companies.\nInsurance would also be in preparation for the rest of the events.\nIn order to follow all the news of the project as well as the progress of the development, here are the official links to the IsoWallet project:\nWebsite – Twitter – Instagram – Discord – Medium\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "url": "https://nonfungible.com/news/opinions/should-we-barter-nfts",
    "title": "Should we barter NFTs?",
    "time": "October 09, 2018",
    "content": "I had the chance to discuss NFT bartering regularly these last couple weeks with cryptocurrency experts, start-ups, curious, passionate and NFT token holders, through Meetups in France or more recently, at the Delta Summit in Malta.\nIt was extremely motivating and exciting to see the positivity around these new digital assets, to discuss the possibilities, and to measure the almost infinite potential they offer.\nMoreover, it was extremely pleasant to feel the support of all these people for the NonFungible.com project!\nDuring these various discussions, a rather recurring question popped up, and I think it deserves to be addressed in depth:\n“Will it be possible to exchange a NFT for another NFT without going through cryptocurrencies?”\nWhy this question?\nFirst of all, we have to look at the foundation of this question. NFTs are still very young assets, which is why their use, their pitfalls, and opportunities are still, not yet completely obvious.\nNFTs inherit many properties and ideas that are associated with their older brothers, cryptocurrencies. The issue we are discussing today is a shining example. In the cryptosphere, the exchanges play a key role that promotes token circulation. It is therefore quite predictable that some users implicitly expect comparable tools for these new digital assets.\nSeen from afar, NFTs are nothing more than new tokens on the blockchain, so why not trade them like any other token?\nWhy is it more complicated than it seems?\nSimply because non-fungible tokens are not like the other tokens:\nThus, NFTs can be more easily compared to objects of everyday life (a house, a cat, a Pokemon card, …) than a currency.\nSetting up a non-fungible token exchange system without going through a (crypto) currency would be nothing less than barter.\nIs it technically possible to do it?\nYes. Technically, mathematically and functionally speaking it is obviously possible to set up a system to exchange two CryptoKitties against a LAND, or an Ember Sword asset against an Axie Infinity creature, depending on the value of the asset.\nFrom a purely financial point of view, we are able to define the value of each asset according to its value system, for example, it’s native cryptocurrency (knowing that not all NFTs are based on the same cryptocurrency).\nLet’s imagine that a CryptoKitties player is tired of the game and decides to start a business in Decentraland. He knows that his Kitties have value and wants to get rid of them to purchase a parcel of LAND in Decentraland.\nFirstly, Cryptokitties are traded and valued based on Ethereum, whereas LAND is traded using MANA. This does not make conversion impossible but simply requires an extra step. The transaction today would look like this.\nSo, if a system allows one day to convert directly\nThis will simply mean that the two intermediate steps have been automatically handled by the system without any possible check by the buyer or seller upon those conversions.\nShould we do it?\nTHIS is the real core question. Being able to do it doesn’t necessarily imply that we should do it, or that it makes sense to do it.\nTo get back to our earlier example, a CryptoKitties player wishing to exchange his collection for a LAND without going through any (crypto)currency. I’m not convinced personally that it is a real use case for several reasons.\n1) Bartering is no longer practiced today for good reasons. You do not buy an apartment for a piece of art, and you do not go to the supermarket with your own tomatoes to exchange for peppers. The monetary system, in spite of all its flaws, makes it possible to structure a coherent and global value system. This refers to two of the 3 roles of currency in our civilization:\n“Unit of account — Currency makes it possible to be aware of the relative value of goods, and to make choices accordingly. It thus makes possible the economic calculation, that is to say the allocation of resources where they are most useful, their optimal use. It thus avoids shortages, and, more generally, makes a prosperous society possible by allowing the decisions of millions of individuals to be coordinated on the market. Without currency as a unit of account, no mechanism of prices, no economic calculation, no prosperity, no civilization.\nIntermediate exchange — The currency makes possible exchanges that would be much too complex, and therefore impossible, with the simple barter. It makes possible any division of labor beyond the level of mere survival, so civilization.”\nTranslated from: http://laissez-faire.ch/fr/articles/les-trois-fonctions-de-la-monnaie-et-leur-sabotage/\n2) The question of the monetary role of the asset also arises. CryptoKitties, just like LAND are not (and have not been designed to be) reference units of value.\n3) For myself, the non-divisibility of the NFT represents the last reason why NFT barter is not a use that will become dominant in the ecosystem. 1 € \u003d 0.66 CAD. Ok. Now imagine that a LAND \u003d 10.762 Cryptokitties. What do we do with the remaining 0.762 Kitties? Should we have partial ownership of this Kitty? Should we consider selling only the body and not the head of the Kitty? These assets cannot be deconstructed and sold for pieces, which makes the valuation and exchange of NFTs for other NFTs without an intermediate value system too complicated.\nIn conclusion…\nAs you cannot imagine valuing a Lamborghini in yogurts, I do not think it makes sense to value/trade an NFT for another NFT.\nFinally, we must acknowledge that barter has always existed in the digital universe as well as in the real world and that it will obviously not disappear. But it is and will remain unconventional.\nWe are very interested to discuss this subject with you. Do you think the NFT exchange is a real use case? Is it required? Will it be popular?\n",

    "content": "NFTs can be used to connect the real world and the virtual world, even more so when the real world community is already federated. For the sports industry, it was therefore very natural to develop projects around NFTs to be as close as possible to their community. Whether it’s Adidas, Nike, the NHL or Formula One, all these major brands have made a project or have taken a strong interest in the web3 environment.\nOne of the latest companies to join the big brands using the benefits offered by NFTs is the French company PMU. With the Stables project, the bet horsing company wants to create a privileged environment between its community and horse racing. But PMU wants to go beyond their own community and expand their world to what Web3 offers the best : a new audience, a new public and new horizons!\nPresentation of PMU and Stables\nThe PMU is the European leader and n°3 worldwide in horse betting whose economic mission is to finance the French equestrian sector. Their experience in horse racing as well as their in-depth knowledge of this sector will be put to work in Stables.\nThe Stables project was created in partnership with 321founded, a French corporate start-up studio whose job is to create start-ups on behalf of institutions. And to achieve their goals, they have recruited talented web3 experts, professionals from the equestrian world and a video game studio.\nBecause yes, Stables will be a fantasy game that will use NFT in its gameplay using the Tezos blockchain.\nAn Ambitious Horses Fantasy Game\nStables will be a fantasy game, meaning real-world elements will be used in the game for a more immersive experience. And since it is a fantasy game, several customization options will be available for your horses\nThanks to the use of 10 years of historical race data from the PMU, Stables will be able to create digital duplicates of already existing horses and stables. These doubles will be Stables’ Genesis collection for the first drop.\nHundreds of attributes have been drawn to pixel-perfection by artists with an original and unique style all in 3D. For this first launch, minting at the drop will give you access to the Early Access Pack, which contains:\nFrom Q3 2023, it will become possible to virtually improve and modify performance and results charts. It is therefore at this point that the decisions will become more important and decisive for the strategy you intend to put in place to be the best!\nThe Next Steps of Stables\nStables is in a whitelist period, so we encourage you to follow them on their social networks and their Discord. By registering, you will receive a free Stables Pass (ntNFT) which will be your key to the entire Stables universe and the whole process up to the mint of your NFT.\nThe sooner you will be part of this community, the higher the chance you will have to be whitelisted this month. The Stables Whiteslist will open the 9th of January until the end of Q1 2023. The NFT drop will happen.\nThe game will be released in the third quarter of 2023 and international development is scheduled for the very beginning of 2024. Many surprises are therefore expected by this game with multiple promises!\nJoin the race!\nFind the whole universe of Stables on:\n",

    "title": ".Art Domains and Snark Art: the future of digital art and blockchain",
    "time": "May 31, 2022",
    "content": "Art has always had a role in defining the essence of a new era: artists embracing new mediums and new technologies. Not only bring their vision to life but spearhead an ideological, technological, and often social change for the rest of the world.\nThe same is true of the digital world where blockchain is revolutionizing everything. It allows artists to find their audience anywhere in the world, free themselves from the highly regulated gallery and auction world, and gain independence by selling to a whole community of art lovers as opposed to a handful of collectors.\n.Art domains: A Growing adoption\nIn the recent years, a plethora of crypto projects has been finding home with .ART, the fastest growing domain zone for creatives and blockchain geeks. The mission of .Art is to empower the art world by fostering the synergy between art, tech and finance.\nThe 200K+ community counts within itself NFT marketplaces such as async.art and meta.art, liquidity pool all.art, the collaborative community with integrated blockchain option dada.art and digital artists like xcopy.art and Pak, who has an ongoing project on burn.art.\n.ART Domains talked to one of .ART adopters Andy Alekhin, CEO and co-founder of Snark Art agency that works with artists to help them innovate on the blockchain. It was launched over 5 years ago – at the advent of both crypto and of .ART domains – to find out how the industry has evolved, what’s in it for the creative community and how domain names are relevant to all of this.\nInterview of Andy Alekhin, CEO and Co-Founder of Snark Art agency\n.ART Domains: As we know, everything starts with a name and picking one is often a challenge for a newborn project. How did you come up with Snark Art?\nSnark Art: We were inspired by Lewis Carol’s poem “The hunting of the snark” – our company’s philosophy is somewhat similar to that of the author, who gave it the following second title: “The Impossible Voyage of an Improbable Crew to Find an Inconceivable Creature”. That’s what we’ve been doing so far: walking through the darkness of exploration with a great team and a hope to invent new great solutions for the art market.\n.A.D.: What significant changes have you observed in crypto since the launch of Snark Art?\nS.A.: There have been several waves of change in the crypto market. As it often happens, once a new medium appears, it is first used as the old medium but then it becomes recognised as a truly new way of doing things, which opens up infinite possibilities of creation. This is exactly what happened with NFTs. First, there were jpegs and other static pieces that resembled physical art forms but gradually this evolved into collections that are way less expensive but can be purchased by an entire community. With this completely new model everyone ends up earning more and generating more interest”. Another currently evolving trend is interactivity – through generative art and dynamic NFTs.\nThese changes served as a backdrop for a significant shift in perception. It all started with digital artists desperately searching for their place in the classical art world, which perceived them as somewhat inferior. Using blockchain technologies they were able to find their audience, earn millions and ended up in the spotlight – with the rest of the art world now trying to integrate with the new medium. I think it’s a big win for digital art and NFTs.\n.ART Domains: After such a breakthrough, what do you think is next for NFTs and will they revolutionize the art world?\nSnark Art: I don’t think NFTs will replace the entire art world – it is of course much wider than that. But I see a big advantage of NFTs in the fact that they can become the mass market as opposed to the currently prevailing elitist one. Only the privileged few have access to art with an adequate art piece priced at $50K+. NFTs open up completely new possibilities: starting from as little as $100 one can become an owner of an interesting artwork. And since all of this is digital, art gets a little closer to the people – which is always great.\n.AD: Have you encountered any skepticism regarding NFTs in the art community? How do you tackle it?\nS.A.: Skepticism is normal. New art movements are often rejected at first just like it happened with impressionism. But a great artist is always willing to experiment. So, we’re seeing a lot of classical medium artists that want to explore the possibilities of blockchain to gain access to new audiences by expressing their old ideas through new mediums.\nIt’s also important to remember about the effect direct interaction with their community has on artists. There is a dramatic difference between making a couple of artworks a year and selling them to a collector – which is the usual way – and having direct positive feedback from thousands of real supporters that express their admiration by purchasing your artwork. It allows an artist to be a bit of a rock star – this kind of adrenalin and emotions are unforgettable and most artists who experience it once come back to explore the possibility of doing it again.\n.A.D.: As a .ART domain adopter, have you had an opportunity to test our recently launched feature of connecting your domain to your blockchain wallet address, which makes .ART an all-in-one product?\nS.A.: We haven’t used that feature yet but I believe that all experiments where blockchain and NFTs meet domain names have a great potential. It might seem like a novelty but actually Raphael Rosenthal, an artist that pioneered Internet Art, used to sell his digital artworks with corresponding domain names way before the emergence of NFTs as a way to prove their authenticity. DNS provides an additional secure way of digital authenticity certification, which could solve a lot of intellectual property rights issues for new mediums including NFTs”.\n.A.D.: We’re heard that you’ll be launching a new project on og.art this summer– could you give us an exclusive scoop on what it’s all about?\nS.A.: Last year we launched Organic Growth Crystals, a long-term art project with unique mechanics bridging the gap between conventional and NFT art worlds. It became a success with the community having grown to 60K+ participants, a few million dollars in sales and an active secondary market. This made us realize that dynamic NFTs (that keep changing after the purchase) have a great potential.\nOur next project that will be housed on the og.art domain will take this idea to the next level – providing a platform for famous digital artists to experiment with the medium. “OG” is a reference to both Organic Crystals and the legendary Original Gangsters, some of whom we’ll be collaborating with – we’ll be able to share more after the official project launch this summer!\nGet your .ART domain – give crypto a creative touch!\nDigital Innovation in Art award\nSnark Art is an outstanding example of a tech company creating new instruments for innovation, self-actualization and freedom of expression for artists – exactly the kind of enterprise honored by Digital Innovation in Art Award run by .ART Domains in collaboration with Investor Allstars.\nConsidered to be “the Oscars of the tech world”, Investor Allstars will be hosting this year’s ceremony in London on October 6th, 2022. This will be an exclusive event marking the 20th Anniversary of Investor Allstars and the 5th Anniversary of .ART Domains! For a chance to share the table with art world disruptors and tech innovators, enter your project before July 8th – details can be found here.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "content": "Recently, we had the chance to test the beta version of Axie Infinity, and it was an amazing experience!! The concept of the game is very simple: buy small creatures called Axies, train them and send them as a team in the arena to fight an opponent.\nFor those who want to know more about the concept, here is a very good summary of the game, and the Whitepaper.\nJust follow the tutorial described here to test the beta version too.\n[This is not a NonFungible.com sponsored article and has been objectively written by someone who is not a member of the Axie Infinity team]\nGameplay\nWhat is extremely pleasant is that the game manages the different levels of involvement of a player perfectly.\nIf you do not have much time to devote to your little creatures or their training, no problem, you buy it at a good level, and send it directly into the arena! In this case, you do not have to be an advanced user to understand the logic and get into the game.\nIf you are a little more patient, the game immediately takes another dimension!\nYou will have hundreds of factors to take into account to optimize your battles and to be victorious in all the arenas.\nThe characteristics of your Axies:\nTheir special attacks : You’ll have to think about the combination of several special attacks, and how you can counter-balance characteristics with special attacks.\nThe constitution of your team : Each team is composed of 3 Axies, so it creates an incredible amount of possibilities when you own several Axies.\nWhat we appreciated\nLike almost every game, the only way to measure the fun, is to play! We did, and in Axie Inifinity we experienced the deeply addictive aspects that we all discovered in games such as Pokemon or Digimon.\nAt first sight, we note two main differences between Axie Infinity and these games:\nAxie Infinity’s team also paid special attention to story telling and building a rich and consistent universe around their creatures. This universe is described in the encyclopedia that we recommend you to read if you want to dive deeper in their universe.\nNFT Gaming is still a very young field, and we were pleasantly surprised to discover that the project is already extremely advanced, it has a rich graphical universe, the sound design is neat, and we never felt like we were playing an experimental game.\nSome final adjustments\nFirst of all, we have to specify that we had the opportunity to test the beta version of the application! It is a safe bet that the points we have identified here are corrected or improved for the public launch.\nOur global feeling\nWe had a warm welcome on our first connection on their Discord, several members came to offer us help or information to discover the game.\nAlthough it is still a beta version, the experience of the game went very well. Even if we are not regular players of this type of game, we understood the logic of the game and started to adjust our strategies very quickly.\nIn summary: We got hooked on the game immediately.\nWe wish the Axie Infinity team great success and congratulations for the work already done!\nLearn more about Axie Infinity\n",

    "title": "NFT Goes to the Museum",
    "time": "October 21, 2022",
    "content": "One can hardly escape the Bored Apes-starred billboards scattered across Tel Aviv’s highways nowadays. One invites to the city’s largest museum, another to a ‘tomorrow’ exhibition 5 minutes drive away; both for exhibitions of NFTs. Visiting one such, the view was scenic. An AI assistant was busy answering art enthusiasts bombarding her with “what’s all this NFT fuss about anyway” kind of questions. Van Gogh and Chagall, meanwhile, whose masterpieces hung a few meters away, seemed rather lonely. The takeover was striking.\nNot so long ago have art curators despised NFTs. Now they’re exhibiting them.\nTel Aviv is no exception. NFTs are now sweeping the worlds’ museums by the dozens. One critic says they’re “weird“, another “ethereal” (what a hilarious pun), all visit. In Seattle, Amsterdam, even Ukraine: NFT-designated museums are not something reserved for the Metaverse anymore. But more momentous is NFTs’ acceptance as equals among already respectable, well-established, traditionally conservative museums.\nThe Louvre, MoMA, Rijksmuseum, the British Museum. Out of the world’s top 10 art museums, at least 6 have had their share of giving the spotlight to non-fungibles so far. Not only have they been exhibiting NFTs for a while now; they’ve also been busy minting them, including offering some very non-digital artworks for sale on the Mainnet. A recent New York Times article describing the current tide of interest among museums in NFTs, marked the final approval of this phenomenon’s existence.\nOld-timers may remember it hasn’t quite been that way all the way long. “NFTs are an embarrassment to the art world“, read one headline at an art outlet. “Think cryptocurrency is bad? NFTs are even worse“, declared another, right before rhetorically asking “Does anyone aside from tech bros think this is a good idea?“. Another asked “Why Does NFT Art Look So Bad?“, and one more simplisticly announced “NFTs Are Terrible”. Some artists went further to pledge that NFTs Are “the Bane of Their Existence”.\nWhere this hate comes from is quite obvious. Gatekeepers will always shelter their castle from newcomers, even if their castle – conemporary art, in that case – is founded on priding itself for being revolutionary and inviting. Simply put, “the NFT Craze Reveals the Artworld’s Snobbism“, as Martin Herbert’s article in ArtReview goes. Writing there too, J.J. Charlesworth answers similarly in his “Why the Artworld Loves to Hate NFT Art” article.\nBut now a much tougher question arises: why doesn’t the artworld hate NFT that much anymore?\nFollow the Money\nMuseums need money, and NFTs have money. If nothing else, it is this primal need that explains museums’ interest in engaging with NFTs, needless to say minting them. Far from a win for NFTs, this could easily count as another cynical exploitation of them; of which the NFT community is rightfully wary of after seeing too many brands joining at highs and leaving at lows. Except it is actually one of the most striking, unequivocal wins the NFT community has ever known.\nThe very promise of NFT in regards to art is, and always has been, to make it economically viable; to make it profitable. These are not mere words: art has long had a hard time finding funding, receiving it either from oligarchs, nouveaux riches or governments, but always in search for a better business model. NFTs vow to end this search. Some artists welcomed them, and quickly saw their gamble proven right. But the artworld as a whole has clearly been reluctant to adapt, mostly preferring the old and familiar rather than the new and unkown.\nAnd then come the museums, the ‘temples of art’ as one once said. And even if with few praises to the NFT community; even if hesitantly, warily, far from wholeheartedly; even if as a mere tool for lining their pockets – they join the NFT revolution. Probably absentmindedly, perhaps against their own will, the museums have proved what has been clear to web3 savvies but less so to artists themselves: that NFTs solve art’s money problem.\nUsing NFTs, making money off of them, as cynical as it might be, the museums are doing NFTs a greatest service: they are realising their promise. The temple of the artworld – the same artworld that used to disregard NFTs – is now embracing them. Could there be a sweeter win?\nVive la révolution NFT\nIt is not just the money, though. The only thing museums – non-profits, at the end (though ones in desperate need for budget sources) – crave even more than money, is visitors. Despite being elitist and highbrowed at times, their mission statement is nonetheless being visited by the public. That they are exhibiting NFTs means – as intuitive as it is – that the public loves NFTs, or at least is very curious about them. And when the public goes to the museum, it wants to see NFTs there.\nThus NFT goes to the museum. But beyond all the utilitarian motives, beyond the needs and hidden interests, lies one truth NFT’s acceptance to the museum necessarily means: that the artworld finally views it as art. No vocal, enraged article or anti-NFT petition could ever dispute the fact that NFTs are now exhibited next to Chagall and Van Gogh’s paintings. That they have made it to the temple of art.\nThe importance of this approval – as marginal and anecdotal as it may first seem – cannot be overstated. Entering the museum means showcasing NFT’s benefits for the artworld at their most striking, having the upper hand in the public opinion, and being regarded as artistically worthy. Entering the museum means entering the heart of art. It is more than another proof that NFTs are here to stay; more than another battle won over the desperate gaurdians of the artworld. It is the victory.\nFollow the De Moon on Twitter\n",

    "title": "Enter the horses metaverse with Silks",
    "time": "April 19, 2022",
    "content": "Horse racing enthusiasts will soon be able to enjoy an entire metaverse dedicated to this industry. Whether it’s ownership of racehorses, land, or stables, Silks will offer a virtual world experience coupled with strategic play-to-earn gameplay.\nOther horse racing projects exist, but Silks differentiates itself by utilizing a mixed-reality structure that leverages real-world horse racing data. In short, each digital Silks Horse NFT will be linked to the data and performance of a real-world thoroughbred racehorse..\nLet’s take a closer look at this project.\nGame of Silks overview\nThe Silks universe will be built by the Game of Silks team which consists of 24 people. Blockchain professionals, developers, advisors or technicians, here are the main team members:\nWith the future objective of having decentralized management through a DAO, for the moment, Game of Silks will retain a centralized organization for better project management. The objectives are ambitious: a play-to-earn game, a token-based economy, a fully engaged community, and an immersive metaverse experience.\nSilks Tokenomics\nTo have an experience that is as close as possible to reality, Silks defines itself as a derivative play-to-earn metaverse. By integrating all the core concepts around real horse racing, Silks will offer an innovative and interactive ownership experience.\nThe project will use both fungible and non-fungible tokens. Regarding the fungible tokens, two types will exist:\nThe Silks governance token, $SLK, will make it possible to participate in the decision-making processes around the project. To obtain the tokens you can purchase them with $STT (detailed below) and also by being sufficiently active in the community.\nThere will be a supply of 500 million $SLK tokens that will be unlocked over time, with 40% reserved for Silks players.\nThe Silks transaction token, $STT, will be used as a reward for racing and breeding success, in addition to all transactions that will take place in the Silks metaverse. $STT can be converted into $SLK with a rate defined by the DAO and other use cases will be announced in the future.\nThere will be a supply of 5 billion $STT and a burn process will be put in place to have a deflationary economy.\nSeveral types of NFTs will be available in the game and their use will be diverse but also complementary.\nSilks Horses will be the central element of the game. Once a horse is registered as a thoroughbred racehorse in the US, its digital equivalent will be created in Silks. Each Silks Horse NFT will then track the lineage, training progress, and racing results of its real-world counterpart.\nSilks Avatars will represent each player’s unique identity in the Silks ecosystem. They will allow the public to identify who owns the different horses, land and stables in the game. Also, it will be necessary to buy a Silks Horse as well as receive rewards when their real-world thoroughbred wins a race.\nThere will be 202,500 acres of virtual land in the Silks metaverse, with each one acre plot represented as a Land NFT. Land will be necessary for the construction of Stables (also an NFT) that will open up the possibility of staking your horses to receive rewards in $STT. To be able to build a Stable, 10 plots of Land will be needed. Each Stable will be able to accommodate up to 10 horses.\nWhat is the Silks Roadmap?\n2022 will be the year of construction for Silks. Silks first NFT offering will be its Silks Genesis Avatar Collection which is set to drop on April 27th. Subsequent to the sale of their Silks Avatars, the inaugural Silks Horse Mint is slated for this summer.\nThe sale of Land and Stables is scheduled for Q3 2022, while registration for the metaverse will begin in Q4 2022. The metaverse is scheduled to open in 2023.\nSilks’ goal is to develop an ecosystem in line with its community while remaining flexible to be as close as possible to the expectations of players and investors. It is therefore possible that aspects of the gameplay will change depending on the decisions made by the DAO.\nA lot of possibilities ahead\nIn conclusion, Silks’ ambitious bet is to succeed in creating a bridge between the real world and their virtual world to ensure the most dynamic experience possible for its community. Whether it’s to develop Land, manage stables, trade horses, participate in the verification of transactions or engage in the DAO, the gameplay possibilities offered by Silks are endless.\nIn addition, through the use of real-world racehorse performance data, the characteristics of the NFT will evolve over time to enhance immersion in the world of horse racing.\nBeing knowledgeable and aware of the information pertaining to this industry will be a major advantage in making the best strategic choices in the game. But thanks to the other gameplay mechanics of this future metaverse, it will be possible to specialize in other aspects to participate in the construction of Silks!\nDon’t hesitate to read the Silks whitepaper for more information and follow them on their different networks:\nWebsite – Twitter – Discord\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "content": "The metaverse is constantly expanding and evolving to meet the needs of the individuals building it. While a vast majority of the population still does not entirely understand the utility that this burgeoning sector provides, some are eager to turn their love of NFTs and crypto into a full-time occupation. How are metaverses shaping the future of work?\nThe Blockchain: Workplace 3.0\nThe workplace has been undergoing a massive shift away from in-person work in the past few years that was only magnified by COVID lockdowns. Professional workers, which make up nearly 60% of the employment in the US in 2020, have made a massive jump to remote work in the last five years. An expansion of high-speed internet access has made work-from-home a more viable option for individuals worldwide.\nAt the same time, a lack of affordable housing, gas prices, and the increased cost of living in major cities have made individuals reluctant to commute or relocate for job opportunities. In a recent article, Forbes reported that “25% of all professional jobs in North America will be remote by the end of 2022”.\nSo how has this trend affected jobs on the blockchain?\nAs remote jobs surge, so do jobs in the metaverse. According to data from Linkedin, blockchain jobs surged 400% in 2021, 4xs faster than other jobs in the tech industry. The development of an online income is another step closer to metaverse’s goal of entirely digital livelihoods. A virtual world where people can create avatars to interact with each other.\nThis trend presents a unique opportunity for individuals seeking job opportunities in the metaverse. Major corporations are setting the groundwork for remote work, creating a favorable environment for job seekers in the metaverse. Experience working from home is important to both the potential employer and employee. Employees with an ability to self-motivate without the direct involvement of a managerial figure will be far more likely to succeed in a remote position.\nAt the same time, employers with an established to manage and motivate their employees will be far more likely to attract and maintain productive employees.\nTips Before Applying for a Job in the Metaverse\nProspective job-seekers searching for work in the metaverse should keep in mind the same precautions all remote workers take to assure potential employment opportunities are legitimate.\nA recent article by Decrypt highlighted the danger of plagiarized crypto accounts that were attempting to gain information from prospective applicants. Make sure when applying to check for verified accounts. With crypto being a developing industry, there might not always be an account with a checkmark next to their name, so taking steps to ensure that they are actually the correct accounts by checking official websites could be the difference between a scam and a legitimate opportunity.\nScammers are known to copy logos and create fake websites and emails. Researching and finding the job listing on the company’s official website could prevent jobseekers from providing information to a falsified corporation.\nCommon red flags include grammatical errors on the job post and emails that do not contain the organization domain (i.e. [email protected] vs. [email protected]).\nTypically if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it is. Applying to work for organizations that use MLM (Multi-level Marketing), require you to invest money into the organization, or do not guarantee an hourly or salaried wage, is not advisable.\nMost employers will provide a secure way to set up direct deposit after the employee has signed all required paperwork and has a contract in hand.\nJob Opportunities in the Metaverse\nThe metaverse is a constantly expanding new frontier that will provide plenty of opportunities to individuals who are looking to find a way to help to lay the groundwork for the future. Since the industry is still developing, it can be difficult to know what opportunities are available.\nNew companies are constantly being developed in different industries stretching from the fashion industry to game development and tech jobs. While it can be difficult to truly gauge what sort of jobs will be available in the future, some are available today and are looking for qualified individuals.\nThe gaming industry is flourishing in the metaverse. Both experienced and inexperienced game designers have plenty of opportunities to join companies attempting to build virtual/augmented reality games. The gaming industry is highly competitive, so it isn’t surprising that there is already a push for games to become a large part of the metaverse’s economy.\nJobs developing cutting-edge and feature-rich NFT games are particularly popular, and there are currently listings offering salaries ranging from US$82k-152k for experienced game developers.\nTalented writers are always in demand in almost every industry. The metaverse is no exception to that rule. Writers who are talented at composing copywriting articles and creating content for communities will be in high demand in the tech-dominated sector. Storytellers in particular will have a leg up when applying for positions in the gaming industry. The ability to craft a compelling story will be invaluable to games hoping to build a strong following.\nThe NFT community holds the same narrative standards as AAA games and feature films, so only writers with experience should apply. Writing role pay ranges will range depending on your writing speed and how proficient you are at composing error-free work. Typically the range for talented writers will be between US$25k-100k a year.\nWhere there is a technology-driven industry, there is a need for programmers. Programmers can find positions ranging from major companies looking to expand onto the metaverse down to small start-ups looking to build their programs. Programmers will find plenty of opportunities in the metaverse now and in the future to help build the industry.\nCompanies offer between US$71k-150k for individuals willing to work with their development teams. Most are requiring at least some experience working on the blockchain, but some are offering to train programmers who have worked in other areas.\nCommunities are the backbone of the metaverse. NFTs especially centralize around the importance of having a solid community to support, make decisions, and improve projects. Having a dedicated community manager to maintain and promote a community helps a company to grow and filter feedback from its customer.\nThis is why it’s no surprise that community management jobs are in demand in the metaverse. Most NFT Communities are looking for individuals with experience working on Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. Discord managers appear to be the most sought-after position for DAOs and other groups. Typically the range for community managers is between US$25k-75k annually.\nAnother way for organizations to grow the metaverse is through marketing. Having access to marketing professionals who understand how to reach new customers who may be previously unaware of how the metaverse, crypto, and NFTs work. The demand for marketing specialists is high, and talented individuals could have very successful careers promoting new projects.\nBringing experience from marketing jobs outside of the metaverse is important, but those seeking jobs working in crypto should immerse themselves in the communities before applying. Understanding how crypto-investors engage with different communities, properties, and projects will set individuals apart from other applicants. Marketing leads will average between US$50k-160k annually.\nThere are ample options for artists to make a living in the metaverse. Many organizations are looking to partner with talented artists to create everything from games to NFTs. In fact, artists with an established audience could very well produce their own NFT projects without the need to work directly with these companies.\nThe metaverse provides solid opportunities for artists to thrive in the market. While some artists may choose to market their own NFTs, some companies are looking to hire artists to help make their NFT projects a reality. While there really is no set amount that a digital artist could make on the blockchain, artists have a significant advantage, especially in the NFT markets.\nMetaverses: a Safe Career Choice\nWhether a job seeker is looking for a job as a programmer or an artist, there are plenty of opportunities for them to accomplish their goals in the metaverse. As the metaverse grows, those options will only expand. What those future careers may entail is up for some debate.\nMany believe that jobs ranging from construct architects to avatar clothing designers could quickly become available as the industry expands. Opening up roles to individuals who might fall outside the traditional crypto audience will only help to expand and normalize the metaverse and those working in the field.\n",

    "time": "May 11, 2021",
    "content": "The NFT space has been booming, and, while most of the media’s attention might have been focused on big brands names and celebrities discovering this new technology, some projects were headed down building to deliver new features and use cases.\nAavegotchi is one such project that we have covered as being one of the most ambitious, forging its way forward in “gamifying DeFi”. Since instantly selling out the first batch of little pixelated ghosts during the first Haunt in early March, this blockchain game has already implemented some novel concepts:\nHowever, this is only the very beginning of the Aavegotchi adventure. According to the project’s recently unveiled roadmap, there is much more to come!\nRarity Farming\nRarity Farming, whose first season started on April 20, is a massive play-to-play that rewards Aavegotchi holders in three categories:\nThe higher in the leaderboard the Aavegotchi, the better the reward! In addition, due (or thanks) to the postponement of Haunt 2, therefore only 10,000 Aavegotchi were eligible to participate in the first Rarity Farming event event.\nThe total prize pool for the first season is 1.4MM $GHST, and the rewards are paid at the end of each round (there are four rounds for this season). As the first round came to a close last week, 350,000 $GHST was distributed to the top-5000 Aavegotchis from each category. Given that there are less than 6500 Gotchis summoned in total, the vast majority of Gotchis were eligible for a reward! The rarest and most experienced ghost was able to collect over 24,583 GHST ( or ~ $38,955 at the time) — but we wouldn’t expect less from a Gotchi called Winklevoss.\nAnother highlight from the first round is a Gotchi named FELON, who took third place in rarity ranking after equipping their best attire just minutes before the snapshot was taken, shocking many of his rivals. He then immediately disappeared after the snapshot, returning to the shadows.\nPocket wallet and more features to come\nTo be able to collect the Rarity Farming rewards as smoothly as possible, the team behind Aavegotchi have developed several tools, one of which is the “pocket wallet”. This wallet is a bit special because… it makes Aavegotchis wallets themselves!\nRather than receiving the $GHST from Rarity Farming directly into its metamask wallet, the rewards went straight to Aavegotchi’s pockets. Thanks to this new way of distributing assets, we can say that this is the first time on the Polygon network that an NFT also serves as a wallet!\nKnowing that the Gotchi pockets were already used to keep their NFT wearables, all that was missing was fungible assets to complete their usefulness as a true decentralized companion for players.\nThis milestone is just one example of the upcoming features to make this game even richer than it already is. With the unveiling of the V2 roadmap, many more things were announced, here is a summary of the features we expect the most:\nAs it is difficult to be completely precise over such a long time scale, so these dates may alter but if so the teams will make the necessary announcements to warn everyone.\nBoosting the NFT industry at large\nIn just under a few months, Aavegotchi has been able to demonstrate creativity, responsiveness and resilience via various updates, sometimes planned, sometimes voted by the DAO. Little by little, the game continues to evolve and the community starts delivering additional content such as mini-games that help earn extra XP for the Gotchis.\nThe announcements made during the Roadmap V2 unveiling event are a good reminder that despite amassing a very active community in a matter of months, the game itself is at the very early stages of development.\nConsidering the attentiveness with which the Aavegotchi ecosystem is being built, it seems that once the “Gotchiverse” is out, the NFT industry will see even more financial opportunities and technical features that might eventually become mainstream.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "title": "Due Diligence Before Minting an NFT",
    "time": "August 16, 2022",
    "content": "How to analyze an NFT project before making the decision to mint?\nit is essential to ask yourself the right questions before minting an NFT from any new project and to have the correct reflexes to protect yourself! Several key indicators should be taken into account: the team and roadmap, the community (Discord and Twitter), the scarcity and price, the technology and of course the underlying project (art and utility).\nThe Team and the Roadmap\nThe analysis of the team is an important point to consider. The first question to ask is: is the team anonymous, partially anonymous or completely known (doxxed)?\nIt is preferable that the team does not remain anonymous, i.e. that we know their names, ages, professional experiences, etc. as you are less likely to be confronted with certain risks (rug, soft rug, project dropouts, etc.) That being said, if the team is anonymous, as some successful projects have been, it’s not so surprising to find this in the web3.0 ecosystem.\nIf the team is doxxed, what do you need to know about their history? If you are able to assess their relevant past experience, questions worth asking are: is it related to the field of NFTs? Do they have any previous reputation in the field? The founders do not have to be famous, nevertheless , they should have some valid and relevant experience.\nFinally, can we also assess the reputation of the team? For instance if a member has already been involved in a dubious project then this would be a serious red flag. On the contrary, if one of the founders has already been involved in a successful project, then that would be considered to be a very positive point.\nIt is important to look at the roadmap even if it is often simply a future vision for the project. The best policy is to favor original projects with a realistic vision. Also, you must be aware that the roadmap is rarely adheaded to in reality, as its content is based on a project’s future intentions rather than on a rigid structure.\nOn the other hand, you can evaluate the projected realistic approach of the roadmap in relation to the financial resources of the project. Another question, is the team competent enough to execute the plan and does the whole plan sound coherent to you?\nCommunities\nThe analysis of the project’s social networks is a crucial element. The community aspect is very important in most NFT projects. However, we can cite as an exception purely artistic collections like generative art where this methodology is not always so accurate.\nNFT projects use two main social media platforms: Twitter and Discord.\nIt is important to look at the number of followers on Twitter, less than 10,000? More than 100 000? Be careful, the number of followers means absolutely nothing at first glance, you have to check if they are real, projects can easily buy fake followers.\nAn easy method is to look to see if the number of followers corresponds to the engagement on the account (likes, comments, retweets etc). So if the engagement rate looks strange then this should alert you. Ideally, the project shouldn’t have too many farmed followers with giveaways and whitelist contests (WL).\nAnother valuable point to consider on Twitter, is to look if recognized collectors are following the projects account. (for example Zeneca, Punk6529, Takoa, etc). Indeed, if whales have an eye on the project then it is often a positive point. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they approve of the project. They just have an interest.\nIn the NFT ecosystem, Discord is a must. Indeed, the majority of the projects open this type of social network to gather their community. Therefore, the number of members must be analyzed just like on Twitter. It is necessary to check if they are real or fake. The engagement on the posts and the activity of the members can be a good indicator..\nIt is also interesting to cross reference the number of followers on Twitter with the number of members on Discord to see if the two are consistent.\nFor both networks, it is important to pay attention to how these followers were obtained, is it really organic? For example, if you see invitation contests to get a WL then this can be a negative point. Indeed, there are more chances that the Discord is full of bots or multi-accounts.\nRarity and price\nThe number of NFTs and the price of the mint are two essential elements in an analysis. These two pieces of information cannot be bypassed by a project.\nSo, it is logical to ask how many NFTs will be offered. Less than 1000? Between 1000 and 5000? Between 5000 and 10,000? More than 10,000?\nThe lower the supply, the more likely it is that a supply shock can occur. But to correctly analyze this criterion, it is essential to put it in perspective with the interest of the project and the activity of the community. If a project offers 10,000 NFTs and has only 20 likes on Twitter the day of the NFT sale, the supply was probably too high to sell everything.\nThe price is an unavoidable metric to take into account. Does it correspond to the usefulness or the hype of the collection? Is the price in line with market conditions?\nAt the end of 2021, price was not such an important criteria. On the contrary, it can become so in less euphoric market phases.\nWhich blockchains are NFTs based on Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL, Tezos (XTZ)? The largest and most established ecosystem for NFTs is obviously Ethereum (ETH). We can also mention Tezos (XTZ) for generative art and even Solana (SOL).\nYou can also find NFTs on Polygon (Layer 2), Flow, Wax and other blockchains. However, 80% of the NFT market volume is concentrated on Ethereum through several marketplaces (OpenSea, LooksRare, etc). When you consider that volume largely defines price, this is something to take into account.\nThe storage and the way your NFT is generated can affect its value and success. Indeed, your NFT can be on a decentralized blockchain, but if its metadata is stored off-chain then that part of the NFT will not benefit from the security of the blockchain.\nThe actual generation of the NFT and storage can be centralized, which means you are relying on a third party to hold the file. This can create a centralized point of failure. If the server does not maintain your files, the Universal Resource Identifier (URI) of your NFT will simply be a dead link.\nSolutions such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or Arweave offer a decentralized (and more secure) approach to data storage, which increases the security of your NFT image. Thus, it is recommended to take this aspect into account before minting. The more decentralized the storage and generation process is, the more valuable the NFT will be.\nThe project: Art / Utility of the NFT\nThere are many different use cases for NFTs, and you need to be clear about the nature of the project. Is it a purely artistic NFT? What exactly is the purpose of the NFT?\nIf the NFT is a purely artistic project (via a curator like Art Blocks or Quantum for example), the usefulness of the NFT is irrelevant. You need to evaluate the reputation of the artist, the style and originality of the works.\nDo you appreciate art? This is subjective of course, but try to identify current trends and investor preferences in NFTs.\nIt is of course important to understand the purpose of the NFT you are about to purchase. Indeed, Utility NFTs are much more than just digital collectibles. They offer their holders privileges, rights and rewards. You can find several types of utilities (non-exhaustive list):\nConclusion\nAnalyzing NFTs before minting is not an exact science. However, you can improve your chances by studying the key indicators above. It is important to think in terms of the number of red flags, if there are too many then probably best to skip it.\nObviously, research and thorough analysis can help you make the right decision. But experience may be your best bet.\n",

    "content": "Presentation of the Meta Moose Club\nThe idea behind The Meta Moose Club was born in December 2021 with the ambition to create a universe around hunting. The Meta Moose Club is a collection of 10,000 Moose NFT’s with 150+ hand-drawn traits on the Ethereum blockchain. Each and every moose is uniquely, programmatically generated.\nThe team behind the project is composed of 5 members :\nThe presale will open its doors during the month of April and promises many advantages to holders.\nThe Meta Moose Club roadmap\nThe project will be divided into several phases, each of which will be an important step in the project. The first will take place in April and will be the pre-sale of the 10,000 Meta Moose Club (MMC) NFTs.\nOwning one of these NFTs will allow entry into the next Play to Earn game the Meta Moose Club team is working on. Owning two will allow you to be on the whitelist for the 3D version of your Meta Moose.\nThen, the second phase will be the introduction of Meta Moose 3D. During this phase, the 2000 Meta Moose 3D will be presented to the community.\nThe third phase will consist of the launch of Metamoose 3D. The final date will be announced later in their Discord or Telegram. The 4th phase will follow, which will allow you to buy exclusive Merch from the project.\nPhase 5 will be important for the project because it will be the publication of the whitepaper of the game as well as the sale of Land! NFT holders will of course be privileged to be able to participate in this presale before it is opened to the public.\nAfter an introduction to Celestial, the project token, the long-awaited moment of the project is announced for Q3 2023: the official launch of the Meta Moose Lodge Hunting Game beta.\nThe Meta Moose Lodge Hunting Game\nThere is little information about this game scheduled for the third quarter of 2023. But it promises to be innovative! The Meta Moose Lodge would be the first of its kind: a decentralized blockchain based hunting platform where players are able to hunt, breed, buy, sell land, and build.\nThis launch phase will also be a test phase where players can report any bugs they see and improve the end game experience. Hunt for exotic animals, shoot the right one and you can win real prizes like trophies, rare NFTs, tokens and more!\nOf course, it will be possible to breed its Meta Moose in order to obtain others. But that’s not all! You will be able to organize safaris on your Lands! It is therefore a real ecosystem that awaits these 3.0 hunters.\nIn order to fully contribute to the preservation of our wildlife, Meta Moose Club has made it a primary goal to donate to multiple wildlife charities which will all be community chosen!\nIf you have more questions, do not hesitate to join their different networks:\nTwitter – Discord – Youtube – Website – Instagram\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "title": "Metaverses: From Social Networks to Virtual Worlds",
    "time": "January 11, 2022",
    "content": "Since the early 2000s, our online social interactions have evolved far beyond what was once thought possible. Blog reading and website consultation, the staples of the early internet, have given rise to our ability to comment, share media, listen to music, and watch movies, allowing users to connect and expand their knowledge bases globally.\nTo connect and centralize all these interactions, social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, established themselves as essential fixtures in a heavily monopolized market. In order to continue to offer free access to their services, they developed a new way to make money off of their users: gathering our personal information.\nSocial Networks: The Double-Edged Sword\nThe use of our data without the informed consent of the user quickly became a source of debate. Is a service truly free if the user’s data is worth far more than the cost of a subscription could ever be?\nThe resale of our personal data to third parties for advertising purposes has evolved into algorithms updated to offer content “more adapted” to our preferences. The ability to create microtargeted ads designed with the intent to improve service encouraged increased analyses of our online behavior.\nThis increase resulted in several negative consequences:\nOn the other hand, this faster exchange of information has also allowed for more checks and balances to appear in our interactions. Virtual actions have started to have more and more consequences in our real lives. Accountability and a lack of complete anonymity have taken away the ability for most to hide behind a username.\nOverall, it is clear that the need to regain control over our personal data has become crucial.\nRather than questioning and correcting existing problems, Facebook preferred to work on the Diem project (ex-Libra). A digital currency issued and controlled by Facebook. Then in 2021, Facebook renamed itself to Meta. Announcing the establishment of a large interconnected virtual universe for all its users.\nWhat could go wrong?\nNFT and Decentralized virtual worlds\nSince 2018, other virtual world projects have been created. Projects using a public blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). With user-centric policy and horizontal governance through the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).\nIt is important to keep in mind that these projects were created during a bear market. With few users, few means, unenthusiastic investors, and very little interest from the general public.\nDriven by the ambition to create new online experiences in a nascent industry, these decentralized metaverses have all shaped their own identity. While some want to reproduce Second Life, others allow you to create your own video game.\nLet’s take a closer look at the peculiarities of the most famous NFT metaverses today!\nIn 2017, at the beginning of Decentraland, there was a map cut into 40,000 virtual Lands. The particularity of these Lands is that each of them is an NFT. Although Etheria has been present in the ecosystem since 2015, Decentraland was the first project on Ethereum of its kind to use the ERC-721 standard.\nDecentraland’s goal is to offer an open and compatible virtual world in virtual reality. Users can freely browse the map and interact with the different elements of the décor. Land owners enjoy great creative freedom thanks to the various tools at their disposal.\nWe were able to attend several types of events organized in this metaverse:\nTelling the whole story of Decentraland deserved a full article on the subject. Do not hesitate to read it to understand the journey made by this project!\nLaunched in 2018, The Sandbox aims to create a virtual world entirely dedicated to user-created video games. With a graphic style in Voxels, many tools are offered to users and players to create an infinity of objects, adventures, and universes.\nTo host the game of your dreams, each LAND is an NFT on which it is possible to build a dedicated universe. And to make it easier to build these universes, several tools are available to create objects, characters, and monsters. Users and players are encouraged to develop new worlds, but not only! The Sandbox has forged numerous partnerships with brands and IPs around the world.\nThe economy in The Sandbox is also paramount. To be able to realize the concept of play to earn (P2E) in its metaverse, The Sandbox has built its universe around the token $SAND.\nThis token serves as both a governance token and a utility token to exchange NFTs on the various marketplaces.\nAppearing in 2018, CryptoVoxels is a metaverse that puts artists at the center of the project. In this universe, each plot of land is an NFT and can accommodate buildings in the Voxel style.\nWith CryptoVoxels, the idea has always been to give creators a lot of freedom. Museums, exhibitions, festive events or sometimes unique architecture, everyone is free to create the building they want to host various events.\nWe went there in 2020 to share our feelings on this project that managed to bring together the original community of the most famous crypto artists that continues to grow over the years.\nMetaverses are interconnected virtual worlds.\nOne word comes up regularly in metaverse projects: interoperability. According to the Cambridge dictionary, Interoperability is “the degree to which two products, programs, etc. can be used together, or the quality of being able to be used together”.\nToday, it is not possible to have the same building in Decentraland and CryptoVoxels at the same time. Similarly, objects created in The Sandbox cannot be used in Decentraland and vice versa.\nYet, thanks to the interoperability offered by the ERC-721 and 1155 standards, it will be only a matter of time before that happens. For the moment, everyone has managed to integrate other projects such as artistic marketplaces (SuperRare, Makersplace, Known Origin…).\nThe interconnected galaxy of NFTs is taking shape day by day, but “the Metaverse” is still far from being accomplished. In the end, the metaverse is the conglomeration of all of these worlds together.\nNFTs bring endless new possibilities to the web industry, and virtual worlds will enable an even more complete online life. But as always its important to keep in mind the historical knowledge of how current social networks have evolved to ensure we do not reproduce the same mistakes in this new global universe!\n",

    "title": "The good and the bad about blockchain business pitches: where are we going?",
    "time": "November 23, 2018",
    "content": "A few important remarks to begin with.\nOver the last few months, I had the opportunity to attend a large number of MeetUps, blockchain events, conferences, and have been confronted with many ICO and blockchain startup pitches.\nI have observed several very interesting things:\nWhat does a good blockchain startup pitch look like?\nFor me, what defines the quality of a startup pitch, lies in the promise of value. In most cases, a technological choice is not, in itself, a promise of value. A little reminder to arrive at this conclusion: taking an existing service, extremely profitable and solving a concrete problem, then simply putting it on a blockchain is NOT a promise of value.\nAdding the terms “decentralized” or “transparency” to Uber is unfortunately, not enough of an incentive to disrupt the transportation industry. Similarly, building “AirBNB on the blockchain”, “Block-Facebook”, or any GAFA on the blockchain is not a project — it is a copycat with a buzz-word. These projects may provide real value but their target market is incredibly niche.\nThis startup pitch method is based on a recurring business model: Re-create a concept that weighs billions, add the blockchain keyword, and hope that at least a few crumbs will fall from this unnatural union.\nMatt Lockyer sums up the current token ecosystem well in his article “Money for nothing and tokens for free” — https://hackernoon.com/money-for-nothing-and-tokens-for-free-1a280159e138\nThus, a “good” blockchain startup pitch does not rely on the fact that the project is based on blockchain technology, but on the value that the project provides itself.\nYou do not promote a best-seller by boasting about the quality of the paper it is printed on.\nBlockchain is a medium. Users don’t care about the medium — they care about utility and experience.\nUsers care about the value of the service, not whether it has potential to be disruptive or not.\nThe values of blockchain\nIf we had to summarize the blockchain in a few words, I think we would use the following terms:\nThese 4 ingredients are real technological and functional opportunities with the potential to deeply change the face of many sectors including finance, information, gaming, etc… However, for blockchain’s benefit, it is important to keep in mind that “blockchain” is not the answer to every question, and it is not going to “disrupt” every business model. Too many projects are still trying to simply stick some of those 4 values to any industry in order to disrupt it — it is not enough.\nBringing better traceability to Uber, more transparency to AirBnB, or decentralizing Amazon, does not provide enough value to users relative to the amount of additional complexities it introduces. These blockchain features alone are not solving existing problems or, providing enough value for users to actually use them over existing solutions.\nAnd above all, let’s not forget that we are talking about companies that generate billions of revenue dollars in the year. I am extremely skeptical that these companies could be overthrown or disrupted by a third party player who is rebuilding their same model “on-chain”.\nWhere will the next Blockchain bubble come from?\nThe speculative bubble observed in December 2017 / January 2018 was a small bubble based only on financial speculation. It has undeniably hurt the crypto-financial markets, but at the same time has given tremendous visibility to the technology and the entire ecosystem.\nThe next bubble to come will not only be financial, it will be a deeper bubble — the blockchain-“disruption” bubble. That day, is when the entire ecosystem (entrepreneurs, investors, individuals, mainstream, …) will realize that YES, the blockchain has a huge potential, but NO, the blockchain is not the solution to every problem.\nIn the worst-case scenario\n99% of blockchain startups will face their own limits and lack-of-value, and will eventually collapse. Let’s keep in mind that outside of blockchain, almost 90% of startups failed.\nSource: https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate\nInvestors (Business Angels, Venture Companies, ICO participants, …) will assume significant financial losses, whose impact could be felt more widely on the economy. In any case, this collapse and awareness may throw doubt on the potential of the technology, and blockchain will once again be considered “dead” before returning from the ashes.\nI believe blockchain will follow the adoption curve described by Gartner, and that we are fast approaching the “Peak of inflated expectations”, which will take us directly to the “Trough of disillusionment”.\nIn the best-case scenario\nMost of these blockchain startups are bought by others, and this phase of all-out entrepreneurship will have trained the population to these new technologies. A generation of entrepreneurs will have been sensitized to blockchain and it is a safe bet that this will boost the whole ecosystem.\nWith the solutions to fabricated problems removed, workforce trained, and the genuine entrepreneurs thriving, the ecosystem will benefit from healthy but exceptional growth as we observed in the years leading up to the tech bubble.\nSome positive thoughts to conclude\nOf course, this is only one future perspective for blockchain. With this evaluation we want to refocus the debate on how to create true utility and value using blockchain instead of hype and wishful thinking. We would like any new blockchain project to answer those two simple questions before launching:\nWhat value will my product bring to my users?\nHow will blockchain help my project technologically, more than any other technology?\n",

    "content": "Launching a Web3 project may seem complicated at first sight. However, there are solutions that facilitate access and use of tools to create your first NFT collections without code knowledge. This is the case of Certhis, a no-code solution for companies and brands that want to create their Web3 project.\nPresentation of Certhis\nCerthis is a platform that simplifies the process of creating and selling NFTs for businesses and creators. The platform offers several tools and features that greatly facilitate the creation, management and sale of NFT collections.\nThe project has been in preparation since 2021 by its founders Ruben Perez (CTO \u0026 CPO) and Henry Korchia (CEO). After two years of preparation, the Proof of Concept was launched in France during Q1 2023 with several French agencies such as Wild, La-Mine and Wagmi studio and the integration of Web3 applications such as Tropee and Nilos.\nCerthis’ features cover a wide range of possibilities:\nSuitable for companies or entrepreneurs who want to get started in the Web3, this no-code solution is primarily aimed at an audience that is used to seamless experience.\nAn all-in-one solution for businesses\nCerthis is primarily aimed at companies that want to address a web3 audience but have little knowledge of this ecosystem. The “All in One” solution that Certhis offers aims to consolidate the link that a company or brand can have with its community through community-driven experiences, new revenue streams but especially a seamless wallet to manage its funds, NFTs and utilities.\nBrands can integrate their NFT marketplace on their website, under their brand. The marketplace offered by Certhis will be an essential tool to keep an eye on the activity of a collection but also to take advantage of the benefits brought by Web3. The choice between 4 blockchains offers flexibility to follow your audience but in addition, a multi-chain royalty system has been set up to ensure revenue for each sale on the secondary market.\nCerthis allows you to create, deploy and sell and/or send NFTs that will come from multiple types of collection types like: Single, retail or art catalog or Art series. For example, Single collections will be more suitable for artists, while Art series collections can be used for NFT reveals.\nAnother important aspect of the marketplace will be the generation of data about the holders. As any transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it will be possible to publicly follow the evolution of a mint, the number of resales, wallets, and other market indicators regarding any collection created on the platform.\nCerthis’ next steps\nCerthis’ next steps are clear: continue to democratize the use of Web3 for a Web2 audience. During 2023, Certhis intends to extend its activities and partnerships to all major Web2 and Web3 agencies and partners but also to open up the development of utility applications for their solution to a broader developer community.\nThe goal within two years is to continue to expand partnerships globally and then expand marketing activity in all territories. By focusing on the many features they offer, Certhis wants to prove that Web3 tools are accessible to the wider world, companies, individual entrepreneurs but also artists and startups.\nToday Certhis is free to use thanks to an economical system based on mint and resale fees.\nThe democratization of NFTs is underway\nMore and more people want to get started with NFTs but technical barriers to entry can sometimes cause some issues. Certhis proposes to ease this process by further simplifying the usual Web3 tools. For projects that do not want to invest a lot of time in the technical aspect of NFTs, this is a perfectly suited solution.\nDo not hesitate to follow Certhis on their different networks to stay tuned about their updates!\nWebsite – Twitter – Linkedin – Telegram – Instagram – Discord\n",

    "title": "Gamified Yield Farming!? 3 big takeaways from Aavegotchi’s metaverse reveal",
    "time": "June 23, 2021",
    "content": "Aavegotchi have established themselves as one of the premier NFT crypto avatars with their innovative approaches to personality traits, on-chain storage and Aave-partnered DeFi capabilities. One area that has til now remained a question mark, is the future integration of a virtual world for these cute ghosts to inhabit.\nPixelcraft Studios, the core dev team, has long promised an expansion of Aavegotchis into the metaverse. But definitions for a metaverse are all over the map and so there’s been no clear indication of what this expanded environment would look like. Til this week, that is!\nAavegotchi’s Metaverse: The Gotchiverse Realm\nWednesday, June 23rd saw the official Aavegotchi Twitter (@aavegotchi) host a Twitter Spaces event to reveal a brand new lite paper dedicated to what they are calling, “The Gotchiverse Realm”.\nThe Gotchiverse Realm is described as the homeworld for Aavegotchis to inhabit and participants in the online event were treated to a high level overview of the various game mechanics and tokenomics of their take on what a crypto metaverse can be.\nDigital real estate and the gamification of NFTs are already gaining a significant amount of attention with leading projects like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels active in this space. With the potential of this space growing week by week, we’re excited to share three key features that The Gotchiverse is promising.\nYield Generating land parcels\nThere is a reason for The Gotchiverse’s diverse regions that goes beyond aesthetics. While most metaverse project’s offer parcels of various size and shape, each Realm parcel also comes with a unique mix of “resources” under its soil.\nOwning a parcel is more than a sandbox to build on, but also access to four distinct resources known as $ALPHA, $FOMO, $FUD and $KEK. These resources are necessary for crafting a wide variety of NFT “installations” on top of parcels. Each of these four resources are technically ERC20 tokens and it is up to you and your Aavegotchi to effectively farm the parcels.\nThe “treasure map” provided subtly indicates which resources one is most likely to farm. For example, blue waterways indicate an abundance of ALPHA whereas the bright hot lava areas will certainly offer more FOMO to be farmed.\nOne important note is a sense of scale. The team stated on call that it takes a single Aavegotchi over one hour to cross the Realm from east to west. It also appears that the Citaadel offers a special gameplay zone that is roughly 20% of the entire Realm’s space. It’s explained that farming of all four resources is also available inside the Citaadel with one key being the lack of competitive “tower defense” type game play scenarios inside the Citaadel.\nThat means we can look forward to a truly RPG gaming inspired experience in addition to the typical buildings and yield farming.\nFree-to-play, one-time-use NFTs\nThe Aavegotchi’s arch nemesis was also revealed. Known as “The Liquidators”, these creatures are actually competing with Aavegotchis for resources that often “leak” onto the surface of the world. The result is described as the equivalent of a big easter egg hunt where players are incentivized to explore and snatch up yield first.\nLike Aavegotchis, Liquidators are unique NFTs that can be your game character of choice. Unlike Aavegotchis, these Liquidators are meant to offer a free-to-play entry point with no cap on supply and limited collectability.\nThis is a fascinating new use case for NFTs that seems to be geared toward mass adoption where everyone will have a means to chasing down the Alchemica Resources.\nA fairly distributed world\nThe first generation of Aavegotchis (known as Haunt 1) were sold in March 2021 via a typical NFT Drop or “first come first serve” model. That saw 10,000 Aavegotchi NFTs sell out in about 1 minute. While most would call it a success, the core team were not satisfied with the amount of stress and disappointment this sales model caused much of the Aavegotchi fanbase.\nThe situation prompted the team (and the AavegotchiDAO) to carefully consider new, potentially better approaches to large scale NFT sales. It was confirmed at the Twitter Spaces call that a “bid-to-earn” auction model powered by crypto auction experts, GBM, is in the works for both Haunt 2 (this July) and the first REALM parcel pre-sale in August. The auction method leaves the door open for 72 hours and enables everyone to take their time bidding on any available parcel over that period.\nPerhaps even more surprising is the confirmation that only 80% of pre-sale #1 parcels will be auctioned while the remaining 20% of parcels will all be distributed via a Chainlink VRF raffle.\nWhile Aavegotchi is famous for having perfected Chainlink-powered raffles, the size and scope of this raffle announcement is still quite shocking. To facilitate this, a new ERC-1155 was introduced, aptly called “Drop Tickets”.\nAnyone staking Aavegotchi’s GHST token earns FRENS points which can soon be exchanged for these Drop Tickets. There are also a number of ways to win drop tickets, with the team allocating 10,000 USD worth of funding toward ticket giveaways.\nWith the REALM presale still a couple months away, we all have some time to farm or earn some sweet Drop Tickets. It’s understood that the raffle will take place during the same time window as the auction itself. Though exact dates remain to be confirmed.\nIf someone wants to use their Drop Tickets before the August sale, it is worth noting that Drop Tickets can be traded on the Aavegotchi marketplace and will also work in a similar raffle confirmed for Haunt 2, second generation Aavegotchis this July.\nYou can read The Realm lite paper in its entirety here or join the Aavegotchi conversation at the official Discord and Telegram.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "content": "A technologically advanced society like Japan is a natural place for non-fungible tokens to flourish. And while the adoption of NFTs has been slow in Japan thus far, we believe the conditions are ideal for sustained growth and innovation.\nNFT’s Home in the East\nJapanese values align with the essential nature of NFTs. For instance, omoiyari — awareness and consideration of others — is taught to Japanese school children from an early age. This principle parallels the community building and concern for barriers to entry common to NFT projects. Values like ganbaru (effort) and gaman (enduring) cultivated from years of quality education and broader socialization propel continued learning essential to Web3 technologies and overcoming barriers.\nThe Japanese NFT community is in its early days. In this article, we’ll provide an overview of the community from the standpoint of cultural exports, namely the mangaverse and gaming.\nAnime and the Mangaverse\nJapanese animation, known as anime, takes inspiration from manga. Manga parallel the comic books of the Western world from which they arose after World War II. And so we have the term ‘mangaverse’ which plays off ‘metaverse’. The visual nature and rich heritage behind established manga and anime present natural opportunities for transfer into the metaverse in the form of non-fungible tokens.\nOtakuCoin presents itself as a community for anime lovers. Otaku is a Japanese term that refers to someone with an intense interest in something, often anime. In the OtakuCoin app, community members receive coins by expressing their adoration for anime, watching trailers, and sharing information to social media. The direct feedback anime studios receive closes the gap between audience and creators.\nOne popular mangaverse NFT project is CloneX. According to our data at the time of writing this article, CloneX ranks sixth among collectibles offered on the Ethereum blockchain. RTFKT (pronounced ‘artifact’) and contemporary Japanese artist Takashi Murakami collaborated on this project that blends commercial art, streetwear, and metaverse experimentation in the shape of avatars. The collaboration makes sense because RTFKT is a strictly metaverse brand while Murakami is one of the wealthiest living artists. His name brings instant recognition and credibility to any project.\nUnlike offerings from legacy brands, the CloneX team emphasizes how their creation has been made for the metaverse rather than transferred into it from an historical brand’s back catalog. Their Web3 avatars can be worn by their owners in the metaverse. At the same time, we can see correspondences between Murakami’s earlier work where cute, manga-inspired characters float amid flat abstract landscapes on a swooping wave from Hokusai.\nHowever, in the form of an NFT, Murakami’s work becomes closer to the audience, an extension of its owner whereas his prior work existed as objects alone. That NFTs can drive innovation in the work of one of the world’s most celebrated artists speaks to their generational rarity as a force for artistic metamorphosis.\nThe cuteness of Clone X avatars comes with an edge. On the other hand, Murakami’s flowers project takes the edge off in bright dot art that calls back to Japanese TV games of the 1970s. There is some menace lurking though. The number 108, which alludes to bonnō, or earthly temptations, counterpoints their colorful exuberance. That same number also serves as a pivot point for the project because the combination of 108 backgrounds and 108 flower images add up to the total 11,664 non-fungible tokens available.\nHeld completely in the metaverse in the Spring of 2022, NFT Festa brought together over 500 NFT artists with an emphasis on French and Japanese creators. The week-long event was free to attend and required no cryptowallet. Anyone who could create a project was allowed to submit their data, which argues for the more level playing field of NFTs. Unknowns could find themselves adjacent to a recognized, respected figure in the exhibition!\nAt the time of this article’s posting, Azuki ranked as the fifth most popular NFT project among collectibles according to our data. Purchase of an Azuki NFT grants a user entrance to The Garden metaverse. At the core of the Azuki metaverse we find the ethos that guides NFTs themselves:\nAlthough Azuki is directly inspired by manga culture, we wanted to precise that the project is not Japanese. It does, however, mark a recognition of the NFT community in relation to this culture.\nBlockchain Gaming and Japan\nGames are common to many non-fungible token projects. In the very early stage of blockchain gaming, two japanese games were released: My Crypto Heroes and Brave Frontier Heroes by Double Jump Tokyo. But we could say that the approval of the Enjin Coin by the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association in March 2021 opened the door for more projects in the Japanese market.\nThe Azuki community plans a game for its metaverse and Murakami’s NFT flowers recall the early years of Japanese gaming. Some of those early gaming brands are still in operation. Among them, Nintendo and Sega have voiced interest in NFT projects, though they’ve yet to describe the shape their projects might take. Square Enix, on the other hand, has fully committed to the potential of NFTs, blockchain games, and the metaverse in general\nThus far, Enjin Coin‘s (ENJ) major contribution consists of receiving approval from the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). ENJ is the first gaming token to receive such approval. It was created by the Singapore-based company of the same name whose gaming platform has over 20 million users.\nENJ”s main strength is that it’s designed with gaming in mind, unlike many other cryptocurrencies. Enjin serves as a common currency across multiple games where players can earn NFT loot.\nWe can see from their President’s New Year’s Letter how the metaverse converges with the company’s research and development of AI, XR, and the cloud space. Square Enix’s recent sale of some of their major Western intellectual properties to the Embracer Group for $300 million quantifies the brand’s commitment to funding metaverse ventures, including NFTs.\nDungeon Siege, a Square Enix property, already features in The Sandbox. The Sandbox is an Ethereum-based metaverse built on NFT collectibles. Within The Sandbox, Dungeon Siege players will be able to buy plots of NFTs of LAND and in-game items like avatars.\nThe dynamic between Dungeon Siege and The Sandbox resembles that of the Murakami-RTFKT collaboration: an established metaverse entity and a real-world entity contribute their strengths to exchange benefits that NFT enthusiasts can enjoy. Square Enix has made popular role-playing games (RPGs) for decades, Dungeon Siege being one such title. The Sandbox has established itself as a premier metaverse that has garnered collaborations with Snoop Dogg and SHIBUYA109 Entertainment Corporation.\nPreserving cultural authenticity with NFTs\nAuthenticity carries or sinks many NFT projects. When a nation’s cultural heritage plays a role, as Japan’s does in the cultural exports we’ve discussed here, we argue that authenticity is an even greater concern. NFT and metaverse creators who call back to rich cultural history would do well to build it in as a foundational concern. Likewise for investors. An appealing surface could disguise cultural and historical missteps in a project that attempts to draw on the past without consideration for context.\nThat said, the mangaverse has been established world-wide and big-name Japanese companies have begun to invest heavily in the metaverse. This is a sound foundation for future collaborations and innovations for years to come in the Japanese NFT market.\n",

    "time": "October 24, 2018",
    "content": "“  Are dollars or Bitcoin fungible assets?” – Yes… And no.”\nBefore diving into this strange conversation, we must return to the definition of non-fungible. Only then can we understand why most assumptions of “non-fungible” are incorrect, or at least incomplete.\nI had several passionate debates during Meetups around the definition of non-fungibility. And I must confess… most of these debates turned out to be sterile but, they helped me understand something important: the definition of non-fungibility is everything but obvious.\nLet’s go back to the basic definition of non-fungible.\nNon-fungible definition\nThe definition of a fungible asset is as follows:\n“(especially of goods) being of such nature or kind as to be freely exchangeable or replaceable, in whole or in part, for another of like nature or kind.”\nSource: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fungible\n“Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, as fungibility implies equal value between the assets.”\nSource: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fungibility.asp\nA non-fungible asset therefore has the opposite characteristics to this definition. Those elements are:\nExcellent articles have been written on this topic, explaining what is a non fungible token.\nWhat are NFTs?\n“The potential of the blockchain technology is much more than cryptocurrencies. It will enable people, companies to put…”\nFungible vs non-fungible tokens on the blockchain\nThe most frequently use-cases\nWhy Bitcoin and Dollars are both fungible AND non-fungible.\nTechnically speaking each Bitcoin is definitely unique. This is why it is possible to trace the origin of a Bitcoin, and whether or not it participated in transactions in the “darknet” and subject to censorship.\nIn the same way, each Bitcoin has a unique transaction history that makes it irreplaceable. But we still consider Bitcoin as commonly fungible. Strange… Indeed, it is exchanged as a coin, each Bitcoin has (potentially) the same value as the others, and no one is wronged if two people exchange Bitcoins simultaneously…\nCoins are the historical example of fungible assets in the real world. Traders accept a dollar bill without question (as long as it isn’t counterfeit of course). We could certainly replace all the coins in your wallet with others of the same value without you realizing it, and without having lost any value.\nHowever, a numismatist can tell you that the coins are not identical. Replace the pieces in his collection with yours and the impact will not be the same. However, these are the same coins we talked about earlier. But for him, and with his training, he can tell you that this coin in your wallet had a unique feature that gives it an incredible value, and that each coin is different due to its date of issue, the pattern on it , the small defect or the scratch that it can have on an edge, …\nIn other words, these coins were fungible for you, but not fungible for him. So … what’s the answer?\nWhat do we mean with “non-fungible”?\nThe example of the piece analyzed by you or by a numismatist is quite evocative of this problem. Actually, NO item in this world is really fungible. Even two of the same pieces of furniture, apparently totally identical, have a different serial number, are composed of materials from different trees, …\nWe thus observe a fundamental difference between the technical value and the use value.\nTechnically speaking, Bitcoin is non-fungible. But its use value makes it fungible. For almost all actors today, owning one Bitcoin or another is irrelevant. Only an extremely small part of the community is concerned about the history of their Bitcoin.\nSome people treat NFTs as fungible assets, totally ignoring the use behind them, considering only the financial value of the asset. Two parcels of LAND on the Decentraland Marketplace worth 10,000 MANA may seem totally fungible to an unscrupulous speculator.\nIt is therefore the use value that defines the fungible or non-fungible character of the asset. And not its technical characteristics. The main use of an asset and the perception that one can have of it define fundamentally if the asset is fungible or not.\nIf tomorrow, everybody becomes a numismatist or is passionate about the traceability of his cryptocurrencies, these assets will instantly become non-fungible in use, without their technical characteristics having changed.\n",

    "title": "Three most popular NFT Marketplace Aggregators",
    "time": "June 28, 2022",
    "content": "NFT aggregators gather listings from multiple marketplaces and platforms in one place. This provides buyers with a simplified interface to compare prices and acquire NFTs from different sources. Relevant tools as the market becomes more and more fragmented (OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, NFTX).\nWe will briefly present the 3 main aggregators: Genie.xyz, Gem.xyz and Blur.io.\nGenie.xyz\nLaunched in November 2021, Genie allows NFT collectors to purchase up to 60 NFTs at a time on multiple marketplaces in a single transaction. Depending on the size of the transaction, buyers can potentially save hundreds of dollars in gas fees compared to purchasing each NFT individually.\nGenie displays listings from all major marketplaces: OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, NFT20 and NFTX. In fact, Genie aggregates all the NFTs listed on these marketplaces. If an NFT collection is not indexed, users can enter the collection’s contract address in the search bar. Genie will take approximately 1-2 minutes to index the collection.\nGenie allows you to create a shopping list and purchase NFTs in batches. Collectors can quickly purchase multiple NFTs at the same time, a practice known as “sweeping the floor”. The Genie team recommends that users purchase a maximum of 20 NFTs in a single swap.\nGenie also allows sellers to maximize the exposure of their listings by listing on both OpenSea and LooksRare at the same time.\nOn June 21, 2022, Uniswap Labs announced that it acquired the aggregator Genie.:\n« We see NFTs as another format for value in the growing digital economy—not a separate ecosystem from ERC20s, and they’re already an important gateway to web3. »\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap plans to add a new tab dedicated to NFTs on its main site later this year. DEX will also integrate NFTs into its developers’ APIs and widgets.\nIn order to share some of the value with Genie’s long-time users, Uniswap will perform an airdrop in stablecoin USDC. People who have used Genie at least twice before April 15, 2022 will be eligible.\nGem.xyz\nIt’s hard to talk about an aggregator without mentioning Gem.xyz. They are building a NFT aggregator « giving you A to XYZ access to the entire NFT market. ». The aggregator allows you to:\nLoopifyyy, creator of Treeverse, explained on Twitter the difference between Genie and Gem:\n« The difference between gem and genie is actually miniscule if you think about it and now that opensea will most likely ruin some features (like blocking out looksRare or something) …\nAt the end of April, OpenSea acquired Gem in order to strengthen its position and offer new features. Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, said:\n« OpenSea has acquired Gem to invest in pro experience. As the NFT community grows, we’ve recognized a need to better serve more experienced, pro users, and offer more flexibility and choice to people at every level of experience. »\nGem will continue to operate as an independent company while developing its platform and adding more features, and then some of these features will be gradually integrated into OpenSea.\nBlur.io\nBlur.io is an NFT marketplace for pro traders. Their marketplace empowers traders with real-time liquidity across multiple marketplaces, live data feeds, and comprehensive analytics. Users can execute orders and bulk orders.\nAccording to Blur, other NFT tools are very often focused on retail traders and neglect the needs of professional traders.\n“Our mission is to solve these problems and bring the NFT space to an institutional level while increasing decentralization.”\nBy March 28, Blur had raised $11 million in a seed funding round led by Paradigm. According to Blur, the round also saw participation from Egirl Capital, Keyboard Monkey, Ledgerstatus, 0xmaki, Santiago Santos, Zeneca, Deeze, and Andy (Fractional).\nAfter the acquisitions of Gem by OpenSea and Genie by Uniswap, the Blur platform now stands out for its independence.\nAn indispensable tool for advanced trader\nThe NFT marketplace aggregator tools haven’t been around for very long: Gem and Genie were both launched in January 2022. Despite this,these new players quickly became successful.\nWith the fragmentation of the markets after the launch of the new platforms LooksRare, X2Y2, and many others, there quickly became a need for a service targeted towards advanced collectors looking for an easier way to make bulk purchases. These tools quickly became indispensable for the advanced collector and the industry leaders quickly understood this by acquiring the two main players.\nNifty Gateway has recently moved towards aggregating other marketplaces and Rarible has started to do the same. We will also see how new players such as Blur, which claims to be a tool for professionals, is able to make a place for itself in the sun.\n",

    "content": "After launching its first NFT collection to celebrate the anniversary of the legendary R5, Renault continues its roadmap with a second drop. The new RACING SHOE5 collection will be phygical by combining Collectible NFT and the possibility of claiming a pair of physical shoes.\nRenault NFTs: the R5 series\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Renault 5 (R5) car series, French car brand Renault released its first NFT collection in December 2022: the genR5. Directly inspired by the design of the iconic car, 1972 (in reference to the year the R5 was put on the market) NFT were sold.\nWith four different genR5 models and several levels of rarity, these NFTs made it possible to be part of the community but also to access benefits and bonuses in the real world. For example, 5 holders of “Le Car van” were drawn to watch tennis matches at Rolland Garros from the VIP Village while holders of “TL” were drawn to visit the Atelier of The Originals Renault – La Collection.\nThe rarest NFT (Electric and R5 Turbo) holders will have the privilege of being drawn for more exclusive benefits such as vehicle tests or a free mint for an upcoming drop.\nThis genesis edition aims to draw a link between the past and the present as well as prepare the arrival of a new R5 in 2024.\nThe RACING SHOE5 NFT\nFor this 2nd drop, Renault goes further in innovation and the drop will be pairs of sneakers this time. In connection with the design of the R5 Turbo, NFTs that will initially be in digital form can be claimed for their physical clone which delivery is planned on September 2023.\nThe digital versions of the RACING SHOE5 have been designed so that their collectors can know exactly what they will have if they wish to claim them in the physical world. In particular, it will be possible to:\nIn addition to these interactive experiences, each pair of sneakers will have a digital passport that will contain information related to the RACING SHOE5 such as the production circuit, their origin, the materials used…\nTo have this information in an instant, an NFC chip will be present in each pair and it will be enough to scan the chip with a smartphone to mint the NFT containing the digital passport.\nRacing Shoe5 drop information\nThe drop will take place in Renault’s immersive store which will be online on the day of the drop and will cost 265 euros (about $287) per NFT. It will be possible to pay by credit card or crypto and Gen5 holders will be able to mint 48h the dirty public. Here is the agenda of the sale:\nTo benefit from privileged access to the sale, it will be necessary to go to the Renault Discord or buy a genR5! A maximum of 6 NFT can be purchased per account (one of each color) and delivery of the physical shoes will be scheduled in September.\nDo not hesitate to follow Renault on their different channels to be aware of their latest updates!\nWebsite – Twitter – Discord – Collection Gen5\n",

    "title": "Decentraland: Market Evolution",
    "time": "August 18, 2018",
    "content": "We had already proposed a short analysis of Decentraland’s economy some time ago, about 1 month after the official marketplace launched.\nThe Marketplace has just celebrated its 4 months of operation on July 19th. The opportunity has come again to provide an overview of the project, and the evolution of its market.\nThe context of Decentraland\nLet’s start with a little reminder. The evolution of the LAND market on Decentraland can’t be understood or analyzed without taking into account the global context of cryptocurrencies.\nMANA (Decentraland’s ERC20 token), is in the Top 100 of Cryptocurrencies in terms of capitalization (CoinMarketCap – Decentraland). Despite this market capitalization, MANA follows the Bitcoin fluctuations like any other Cryptocurrency. Thus, the MANA course evolution has to be analyzed while taking into account the Decentraland project’s actuality and the global cryptocurrency market.\nIt’s quite different for LAND. LAND tokens are NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens): more simply, it is a single item, whose characteristics are unique and cannot simply be replaced by any other LAND token. You can read this excellent article written by Decentraland team explaining what a NFT is.\nHere, the unique and non-Fungible features of the token are geographical xy coordinates on a map. LAND parcels may be close to a high traffic area, a road, or a District., all of which can impact the perceived value of that parcel.\nNFTs have this very particular characteristic in the cryptosphere: the evolution of their value is relatively independent from the price of crypto-currencies.\nWe can consider LAND as an unusual NFT: it is far more than a cryptocurrency or cryptocollectible to speculate on. LAND is what makes up the virtual world of Decentraland it embodies the possibility for anyone to build their own business, application, game, or structure in this future ecosystem.\nMarket evolution over 4 last months\nAll data presented in this article as well as in the infographics are provided by NonFungible.com: the reference about NFT Markets evolution.\nIf we have a look at the Decentraland Marketplace’s overall statistics, we can see that the equivalent of $3.5 million USD has been exchanged in less than 4 months, and $1.3 million USD during the period from March 19 to 31.\nThis launch period is obviously the most impressive one: we observed the most expensive sale in the metaverse history: 2,000,000 MANA for a single LAND. We also saw an average of 62 LAND sold per day and an average sale price of 20,324 MANA (approximately $1,714 USD).\nWe need to put this launch in context to understand what happened. Before the launch of the official Decentraland marketplace, LAND was sold in a parallel market based on the trust and reputation of the various stakeholders. A member of the community announced on the Decentraland chat the information about the LAND parcel he or she wanted to sell, and the most interesting offer won the sale.\nThe buyer had to transfer the sum in MANA to the seller’s account, and … cross their fingers hoping that the seller is honest. The arrival of the marketplace represented a considerable evolution in this market with the intervention of a trusted third party that was free, reliable, decentralized.\nParallel market transactions stopped a few days before the Marketplace was released.\nObviously this launch has crystallized a lot of expectations for both. buyers and sellers.\nThis context, and those expectations, can explain the extremely large number of transactions and the prices we’ve seen.\nWe then saw a progressive slowdown in the market in April, with a successive decline of 18% then 45% of the sales volume per month.\nMore interestingly, we noticed that the total amount of MANA exchanged lowered further : -46% on April then -56% in May. This implies that beyond the number of transactions, the overall assets had been devalued.\nIndeed, between March and May, we saw the average value of LAND lowered from 20,324 to 10,615 MANA, a drop of nearly 50% of the NFT value.\nIt is very difficult to precisely identify the reasons for this devaluation, but here are some hints that seem relevant to us:\nNote, however, that the average price of LAND in dollars is the only key performance indicator (KPI) to have increased over May, mainly because of the positive evolution of MANA price.\nAfter analysis, it appears that the evolution of the lowest and the highest prices during the different months does not represent any relevant pattern, since the lowest prices are often determined by mistakes (9.9 MANA, 950 MANA, …), and the highest prices raised some suspicions about the legitimacy of the transaction.\nWe saw an important change in June: the sales volume, average selling price, and overall transaction volume all went up, despite an unfavorable climate in the crypto-sphere.\nThere is a rebound of almost 43% in sales volume, increasing the number of sales per day from 11 to 17.\nThe average price of LAND in MANA also increased by 21% during the month of June, without any “spectacular” sales exceeding one million MANA.\nIt is extremely interesting to note that despite an overall fall in cryptocurrency prices for several months, the LAND market picked up momentum in both sales volume and asset prices.\nRegarding the overall volume traded in MANA, we observed a real boom with an increase of 73% in comparison with the month of May. This increase has to be compared with an increase of only 22% of the volume exchanged in dollars. This is explained by the gradual decline in the price of MANA over the period.\nContrary to our expectations, the LAND market experienced another major decline in July, despite the rebound in June.\nIn July, we saw the lowest number of sales since the opening of the marketplace, with an average sales / day of less than 10, for the first time since March.\nThe volumes traded on the market were impacted accordingly- down 38% compared to the previous month (in MANA).\nIt should be noted, however, that average transaction prices increased, while volume was decreasing. We can conclude that there was a lower volatility of the LANDs but a higher valuation of these assets.\nWe analyze two points in this phenomenon:\nThe purchase value of LAND continues to increase steadily, despite fluctuations in the cryptocurrency markets\nVolatility is still declining, suggesting that speculative logic is slowly fading away.\nGlobal Market Trends\nThe trends of overall sales and transaction volume are perfectly consistent, and follow the trend of declining then stabilizing between March and May, before gradually increasing through June.\nThe average price of LAND in MANA also follows this trend, however it is interesting to note that the price in USD does not experience the same fluctuations as it also depends on the evolution of the price of the MANA, which experienced a significant rise in May.\nIn comparison with the global environment of NFTs, Decentraland is the first platform to propose NFTs with an average value greater than $1,000 USD. It represents an incredible challenge to launch a market and an economy based on items of this price, in a tense economic context for cryptocurrencies.\nWhat defines LAND value?\nDefining the value of a LAND is a complex exercise. We can consider that value of LAND is defined in two stages: the speculative dimension of the asset, and the promise of experience it contains.\nTo take a concrete example, a parcel of 1km2 on Manhattan in the 16th century was cheaper than today. What has changed is not the parcel in itself, it is what we built there. What we made of the parcel defines its actual value.\nUnlike many NFTs today, LAND token offers a second level of value perfectly comparable to these lands on Manhattan.\nWhat defines the value of LAND today (speculation about the hypothetical potential of the land AND the project) is not what will define its value tomorrow (the actual use and the service offered on the parcel and in its direct proximity).\nThe LAND valuation model we have described here will most likely be extremely different in the coming years, depending on the projects launched on the platform and the emerging business models.\n",

    "content": "Whether you’re a newcomer or a veteran in the crypto ecosystem, you must have heard of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This concept aims to automate the various financial mechanisms from traditional finance through decentralised smart contracts.\nIntroduction to Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\nIn DeFi, the economy does not pass through a third party, here are its simplest features:\nLending or borrowing tokens will always be done with a more or less variable rate depending on the service used, this rate also fluctuates depending on the liquidity available and the duration of the operation.\nSwaps can be more or less advantageous depending on the protocols used and as for staking, the number of tokens recovered will vary depending on the number of tokens placed. The bigger your share, the bigger your reward will be.\nThere are other, more complex features:\nThe first two features are often closely related, while Liquidity Mining recovers transaction fees, Yield Farming can offer other types of rewards and its these use cases that are most used in the Non-Fungible Tokens space. Here are some examples of NFT projects that have utilised different mechanisms for their project.\nCometh.io\nCometh.io is one of the first NFT projects to use the power of DeFi to launch its game. The only way to acquire your first Cometh ships was to buy them with $DUST tokens and to acquire these, it would be necessary to stack another of the project’s tokens, $MUST.\nOnce the ships have been obtained, the game can begin. The goal is simple to understand, succeed in placing your ship in the right orbit, enabling you to mine the comets. Except that in practice, it is obviously not so easy, but worth it as for every comet mined, rewards in $MUST are delivered.\nEach ship has its own particularities: speed, mining efficiency and size.\nWe wrote an article about Cometh so you could easily understand the different mechanics from the game, so don’t hesitate to go and read it!\nAavegotchi\nFor users looking to understand deeper the world of DeFi, Aavegotchi is the perfect project! The team behind it are veterans of the crypto and NFT ecosystem and they wanted to maximize what was possible to put on-chain.\nTo summon a Gochi, several steps were necessary:\nAnd once the Gochi has been summoned, the magic really begins! Because the USDT that was used to invoke the Gochi are in essence “stacked’’ in the Gotchis. It is therefore NFTs that serve, thanks to the Aave protocol, to generate interest according to the associated collateral.\nThe world of Aavegotchis has grown enormously in one year and there are still many steps on the roadmap and we wrote several articles on the subject in collaboration with their team. To better understand this complex project in more detail, we invite you to read our articles:\nAlso, the community has been very active in participating with the development of the project, with several ancillary tools have been put in place by and for the community:\nUniswap V3\nWhen it was updated to version 3, the famous Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Uniswap started using NFTs and not to play games or collect images. The chosen use is completely innovative in the sector, Uniswap NFTs are utilised to optimize transaction-related gains for those who deposit liquidity in the various pools.\nUntil then, by depositing a liquidity pair in the DEX, there was no defined limit and users can now set one to optimize the recovered fees.\n“Rather than being required to allocate capital across the entire price spectrum from 0 to infinity, each LP is given full control over what price ranges they wish to provide liquidity to”\n2/ The blogpost provides a high level overview For a detailed technical dive, we recommend reading the Uniswap-v3-core whitepaperhttps://t.co/1TSBI7iz3K\nPrior to this update, the default limit was 0.3% per trade but it is now possible to choose fees ranging from 0.05% to 1%, allowing greater freedom in case of a ‘Take Profit’ strategy or market decline.\nThe DeFi x NFT is still a very experimental field\nAlthough the merge between NFTs and DeFi has immense potential, these two worlds are still very recent and their use is still a very experimental field, therefore it’s important to keep in mind that projects with a focus on DeFi are relatively risky.\nWe could have talked about more projects, created last year, that present interesting concepts. But it is difficult to know at this time whether the use of NFTs in these projects is relevant and above all, planned for the long term.\nMore and more projects that link DeFi and NFTs are make their concepts fun to use and therefore easier to use. This simplified access to Decentralized Finance should not make us forget the due diligence as well as the necessary research we must carry out before using them!\nThat said, these different experiences will have an overall positive impact on the NFT ecosystem to better determine what will and won’t work in the long run..\n",

    "content": "As AMC’s The Walking Dead, the insanely popular series begins its final season on Sunday, October 2, 2022,visionary studio Orange Comet, a world class NFT company, is preparing the crypto world for the continuation of the series and its multifaceted storylines in a P2E Metaverse called “The Walking Dead Lands Universe.”\nOrange Comet, starting on Wednesday, October 5th at 12:00 noon Pacific Time, will launch a mint for 5,000 3-Dimensional NFT Avatars of some of the main characters of The Walking Dead. These 5000 NFTs are the final piece to the P2E gamification of the upcoming metaverse. Will you be one of the lucky souls to obtain one of these amazing pieces and be on your way to setting up shop in the The Walking Dead Lands NFT universe?\nThe Walking Dead NFT: Previous Drops\nThe Walking Dead NFT Collection by Orange Comet, is hosted on OpenSea on the Ethereum blockchain. The list of NFTs previously minted from Orange Comet’s The Walking Dead NFT Collection include:\nThese mints are no longer available from Orange Comet. However, these highly-coveted NFTs can sometimes be found on the secondary market on OpenSea so it’s worth looking into if you’re dying for one.\nThe Walking Dead Avatars\nOne of the main elements of this universe is the Walking Dead characters being represented as avatars that will help guide you through the upcoming Metaverse! Essential to interaction with the elements of the virtual Walking Dead NFT world, these avatars have been handcrafted in 3D. This first wave of NFTs will represent the most emblematic characters of the series (Michonne and her pets, Mercer, Rick Grimes, Carol Peletier, Daryl Dixon…) and others are also planned. Imagine, playing in the TWD Lands Universe with Daryl Dixon as your guide? Or maybe tough as nails Carol Peletier to help you? Many things can be possible in the upcoming metaverse.\nThere will be 10,000 NFTs for this project, which will be minted in two categories:\nSeveral levels of rarity will be available, but to be guaranteed access to a rare NFT, you must be present 24 hours before the allow list and the public list go live.\nInformation About the Walking Dead Avatar Mint\nThe Walking Dead Avatar mint will be divided into two parts. The first mint is reserved for existing Walker Access Pass holders and the second mint is open to the public. The price is set at $80 (adjusted in ETH at the time of sale) and the date will be October 5th 2022.\nDepending on the number of Walker Access Passes held in the wallet, the time for mint will be different. Those wallets that hold 5 or more Walker Access Passes at the time of the snapshot will get 24 hours to mint their Avatar NFTs. A pass will allow you to interact with an Avatar (so 5 passes, 5 avatars). These holders will also benefit from a discount of 0.02 ETH over the $80.00 public price.\nFor owners of 4 Walker Access or less, the mint opening window will be 6 hours and will also have a discount of 0.02 ETH for mint. Finally, during the last two hours of the allow list, Walker Access holders will be able to interact with as many NFTs as they wish.\nRegarding the public sale, the reduction of 0.02 ETH will continue to apply for holders of the Access Pass but the mint will be open to all until the supply is exhausted.\nFor more information on this exciting drop visit: Website – Twitter – Discord\n",

    "content": "The Theft of Digital Art\nNFTs have been erected as a solution to many of the problems faced by digital artists. Unfortunately, in the face of high expectations and false promises, it would seem that NFTs have disappointed the general public.\nCertain practices, including the unauthorized utilization and sale of works found on DeviantArt, Twitter, or other social media platforms, has garnered justifiable disdain towards NFTs. It resulted in creators in the space often being blacklisted from many artist communities. Reposting art that an individual did not create with the intention of taking credit for and profiting from the resale of the content without the express permission of the content creator and proper compensation is an authorized use.\nThe ability to copy and repost artist’s work without licensing or receiving permission from the artist, is an issue that needs to be addressed both within the NFT community, as well as in the general population. This problem is not localized to NFTs, for example how to prevent a tee-shirt store to use licensed art to sell their product?\nCreator’s rights, and their ability to claim ownership of their work, is something that will need to be addressed in order to ensure Web3 is a safe environment for artists to work. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the internet, it is possible for content to be copied infinitely as soon as it is put online.\nNFTs have the ability and have laid out the groundwork to ensure that artists can maintain usage rights for their work, but it is important to make sure that the community moves forward in an ethical and conscientious fashion.\nArtificial Intelligence and Art Reuse\nA recent example of ‘art theft’ that has been raising eyebrows concerns the artificial intelligence Dall-E or OpenAI. With a simple text input, these AIs are able to create artistic visuals corresponding to the desired query.\nWithout going into depth into the technical details, to be able to ‘understand’ the request, these AIs will draw from databases. Databases that are open source for code or with royalty-free images that can be found on internet.\nThe reuse of works is allowed, but taking over for oneself the work of thousands of people without crediting them is ethically questionable.\nNFTs will not be able to solve the problem entirely, but can greatly reduce the risks associated with these practices.\nNFTs are a Certification for Digital Creations\nIf there is a desire for ownership and traceability on a public blockchain, NFTs are a suitable tool. On the other hand, they do not make a distinction on the media associated with them.\nTo avoid confusion, we will talk here about digital visual works and not musical or physical. As a reminder, NFTs are not works of art. They are only a gateway to the artwork.\nNFTs are not a medium, a means of hosting or even recognized by international bodies. For now. They are a way to timestamp information (author, smart-contract, date) on a blockchain. This is why we defined them as ‘digital certificates of authenticity’ that are visible and publicly verifiable.\nThis forgery-proof identification is essential to help decide between two conflicting entities, both in good faith. This is not infallible though, because knowing who minted an NFT does not necessarily prove who created the work first.\nThe NFT revolution in the visual arts therefore essentially concerns the certification of authenticity. No quick wealth “because it’s an NFT” but royalties and lifetime identification of the author.\nWeb3 is About Owning our Data\nToday the NFTs of the artistic segment belong to a niche sector. However, Instagram, Facebook or Twitter are very interested in it. From a more global use perspective of NFTs, this is excellent news, but there are concerns to keep in mind.\nNFTs make it possible to have the certification of a digital asset, this is undeniable. But several questions remain:\nThe fact that the Web2 giants offer NFT-related tools is a good thing, but in the end, it is the artists who will decide what medium they will use for their creation.\nRegarding the storage of the media, no matter how it is put online, it is de facto decentralized in the best possible way thanks to infinite copies.\nThere remains the question of the right to reuse works of art. Copyright has already shown on several occasions that it is useful for those who have the means to initiate long and expensive procedures. The best alternative would therefore be that of Creative Content, because of its accessibility and flexibility. It is up to NFT marketplaces (like Objkt) to offer them to artists during the mint!\n",

    "content": "The esports sector has experienced strong growth around the world during the past decade, with the sector becoming worth more than a billion dollars in 2021. One ongoing issue is the revenue that is generated by this industry suffers unfair distribution. A very large part is recovered by sponsors while gaming streamers get the smallest part of the cake and on the other hand the fan community doesn’t get anything at all.\nCan NFTs change that? This is what Heroez wants to do by proposing a new way to create community around esports.\nWho is behind Heroez?\nHeroez wants to place players and especially their community at the center of their project. The founders come from the world of gaming and so can better identify and respond to the problems of the gamers universe. The team is composed of:\nTo be able to support them in this project, Heroez made several partnerships with The Sandbox, Polygon Studio and Gamerhash, to provide external advice with a team of eight advisors who will also be present.\nWhat is the Heroez Project?\nThe project was born in June 2022 and has several objectives. The first of these is to decentralize the governance of esports teams through a collection of 3000 NFTs. These NFTs will make it possible to vote on the choices that relate to the strategies and direction the team will take in the future. Because that’s the first thing Heroez is all about: federating esports teams under the banner of “Web3”, all with a governance that is looking to be as horizontal as possible.\nOne of Heroez’s other goals is to highlight the value that fans represent. To allow this synergy between players and fans, a DAO will be created to allow NFT holders to organize themselves and propose governance choices.\nIn a community-based way, Heroez seeks to create a new form of esports team management that is more respectful of fan opinion while removing unnecessary fees and trusted third parties.\nBenefits of Heroez NFTs\nHeroez NFTs will have the primary purpose of creating a link between players and fans but they will also allow owners to obtain other benefits. Here is a small non-exhaustive list:\nFar from being limited to the virtual universe, many advantages will therefore be reserved for holders in the real world too. The fact that the commercial rights of the assets accrue to the holders of NFTs will allow them greater freedom if they want to develop their own brand in the future.\nThe next steps for Heroez\nFirst of all, the first step to watch out for will be the mint that will take place on September 27th 2022. This collection will be the cornerstone of the rest of the project and the first decision will be submitted to the DAO very soon after the mint. This decision will concern the first game on which Heroez teams will play.\nHere are the next steps of the project :\nOtherwise, several partnerships have already been made with the biggest gaming projects in the web3 industry. The innovation that Heroez wants to bring to the world of esports is ambitious but far from impossible given the skills of the founders.\n\n",

    "content": "Since last year more and more NFT projects have been using mechanisms inspired by decentralized finance systems. Being described as a modern fairy tale about DeFi and the rise of decentralization, Degen’$ Farm is proposing a different distribution model that is tightly connected with DeFi culture.\nThe game invites farmers to test their crypto farming skills and farm unique Collectibles’ NFT creatures. It’s essentially dynamic art and the game itself is full of modern crypto allusions and irony that might be misunderstood from the first sight.\nLet’s dive a bit deeper into the farm and find out who is behind this project and what can be done with it?\nPresentation of degens.farms\nThe idea of the game was born in January and the project was officially launched at the beginning of June. The team is made up of six people and has Chichi (funky cartoon chick) as a CEO, who has wished to remain anonymous in order to have a free hand and really have some fun with this project.\nThat said, in an interview with NFT Radar, it is interesting to note that the core team has already had some significant experience in the world of music and art for more than 10 years, while the developers have been using Solidity since 2017 and have experience in mobile games for more than seven years.\nIt’s pretty easy to confuse the newcomers with the crazy APY of their main in-game utility token called $DUNG, but it obviously serves the purpose of ‘degen storytelling’.\nWhat is funny – creatures of the farm are the only entities that produce precious $DUNG. Team has never sold any $DUNG and distributed the initial supply for free. After some research it’s becoming clear that the project has some serious smart-contract eco-system driven by Chainlink oracles.\nWhile you can enjoy crazy $DUNG farming, the core playground of the Degen’$ Farm universe is NFT farming, so let’s take a closer look at this process.\nHow does it work?\nAt Degen’$ Farm everything starts with the $BAGZ with the hard cap of 4500 tokens. There are 20 types of creatures on the farm (cows, sheeps, goats etc.), with three levels of rarity: Normies, Chads, and Degens.\nWhile $BAGZ are built as ERC20 tokens, inside the $BAGZ there are 2000 basic Normie creatures and 2500 lands that are both ERC-721. In order to farm next level creatures you put one land and one Normie into the farming cabinet and come back in one week to see what you got – another portion of $DUNG or rare Chad.\nEssentially, 2000 Normies are used to breed 400 Chads, which can then be used to give birth to 20 mighty Degens. The basic probability of Chad farming is 20%, and the basic probability of farming a Degen is 5%. But if you are an experienced DeFi farmer you can affect it!\nAt the moment of giving birth to another animal the probabilities can go up depending on various factors. If you own a horse (related to Uniswap) and are an owner of UNI tokens, the probability of giving birth to a Chad is higher.\nAlso the market momentum affects the probability – if the price of UNI is going up at the moment you’re giving birth, the probability of getting a Chad is higher too. You can also boost your probability by obtaining farming tools that could only be swapped for $DUNG.\nThere’s a lot of farming tips and tricks that could be found in the project docs and hot farming discussions in the Discord.\nConclusion\nWhile most projects on the market are aiming for instant distribution and therefore usually insiders and whales are the primary beneficiaries, Degen’$ Farm provides a different perspective where your DeFi skills and knowledge are playing a crucial role.\nIn a way, this game is a snapshot of the current DeFi landscape and users are not only earning ultra-rare NFT’s, but also learning and improving their farming skills by playing. But what is more important – It’s a fun and engaging way to become a real crypto farmer and collect cute animated creatures with sounds.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "content": "Since NonFungible.com’s inception, the platform has been growing rapidly and changing every day. Our goal of creating an NFT marketplace that crypto beginners can understand has morphed into creating an all encompassing future CoinMarketCap of non-fungible token assets.\nBefore The Beginning\nNonFungible.com began as an idea for an NFT marketplace. While on the hunt for a domain name, I immediately found that NonFungible.com and other variations were available and scooped them up quick. As an avid domain hodler and NFT supporter, I saw the immense opportunity with these names. As soon as I purchased NonFungible.com, I began coding a LAND marketplace smart contract. After countless late nights, I finally finished the smart contract. Once the hard work was finished, I needed to create a beautiful user interface.\nA few days after I implemented our basic user interface prototype, Decentraland announced they were releasing their official LAND marketplace. Additionally, when I started to run with creating an NFT Marketplace, I found other projects like Project Wyvern, Coingecko (ex-RareBits), OpenSea. I decided it was best to re-group and find a new entrance niche.\nFast forward a few weeks later and there was another opportunity, historical pricing for LAND within one unified interface.\nI have been involved in the Decentraland community as a district leader, statistics and tool writer to help the community. Additionally, I have helped support users with their difficult questions in the community chats and helped to build the initial prototype for EthAlarm as well as collected a few bug bounties. With all of this Decentraland experience, I decided that NonFungible.com was a logical transition for me, and thus, it was born!\nThe Goals\nMission Statement: Organizing the infrastructure making fair asset ownership universally accessible.\nVision Statement: Helping crypto-beginners and experts alike understand and discover the opportunities within the non-fungible digital asset (NFT) ecosystems.\nNonFungible.com supports the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a means to achieve truly fair asset ownership. Built on top of blockchain technology to provide desirable decentralized, censorship resistant, immutable properties. Similar to how Bitcoin is the answer to financial ownership and independence, non-fungible tokens are currently the best solution to fair asset ownership.\nSupporting the NFT market with analysis and discovery tools is the just beginning of creating a healthy non-fungible ecosystem. A nice side effect of the market data is that we are also providing greater transparency with the data. We have gotten rid of the need for a programmer to understand and do analysis on the data. We hope to help facilitate the ride and become a key resource in the industry!\nNonFungible.com Prototype v1\nAfter quickly deploying an Ethereum node and creating a blockchain event monitor, I set up a simple website with historical market data for Decentraland. The community support from this initial launch was phenomenal. I am so humbled by the amount of positive support!\nI quickly got to work implementing CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, Etheremon and Etherbots, only to find out that a Parity “fast sync” isn’t going to cut it. Seller information and/or purchase price were missing in a few scenarios. After a little research, I found that I would have to sync a full, unpruned Ethereum node with tracing enabled. This can take a week or longer and requires robust computer hardware and 1 TB of SSD disk space. Whoah! This is not as simple as I was hoping, after setting up some rather powerful temporary servers, the new sync began.\nNonFungible.com Prototype v2\nWe needed to complete the functionality, support a broader community and most importantly, gather all the data for a range of non-fungible projects. For that, I needed time to code but also had to wait for the Ethereum node to fully sync up with the network. I took the week of April 9th off from my day job to focus on NonFungible.com. I’m extremely pleased with NonFungible.com site developments, code, community support and potential revenue streams.\nWith the v2 prototype launch, we officially launched the remaining 3 planned NFTs, gathered the meta data, provided a little more robust searching (still a bit of optimizations to go here), and added USD conversion prices using CoinMarketCap historical open prices. The USD price for historical data before April 18th uses the daily open price. Everything going forward uses the price regularly updated from CoinMarketCap.\nAside from our new, but wickedly successful medium blog, we’ve been working with the NonFungible token community and are in touch with leaders, admins, mods and devs via Discord. Our NonFungible Discord channel aggregates the news from the non-fungible token projects’ Twitter and Discord announcement channels so our users can easily get their news in one unified interface.\nWe have also begun creating an NFT Network for the professionals involved in these NFT projects. We hope to help accelerate their growth and accommodate collaboration within the ecosystem.\nSo…When Moon? What’s Next?\nWe have a number of features on our roadmap that are sure to add more value to the platform which we will be proud to call our official MVP. With the MVP, we should have a strong basis to create sound revenue streams from. Below is a summarized and tentatively ordered list of our current priorities feature-wise.\nOver the next couple months\nThank you for being a part of the non-fungible revolution and for your support with NonFungible.com!\n",

Follow us on Twitter to take advantage of our analysis, predictions, and statistics every day: before, during and after the auction!\nWhat is LAND? Why would I buy one?\nFor those who still ignore it, here’s a little reminder: “LAND”, represents a 10m x 10m piece of the digital universe on the Ethereum Blockchain. LAND is the main component of Decentraland’s metaverse. If you’ve seen Ready Player One, you can consider that every location in the film is an experience, on these LAND in Decentraland.\nOnce you have acquired non-fungible LAND tokens, you are the only one to decide what is built on that LAND in the metaverse.\nIn a nutshell, you can build whatever you want and provide the service you wish to anyone visiting your plot. You decide the rules on your LAND, you actually own it!\nHow will this LAND auction work?\nFor this second auction, Decentraland chose the Dutch Auction system. The principle is simple:\nThe challenge will be to take the risk of waiting for the price of the desired parcel to fall. But, take care not to wait too much because there will be hundreds of anxious buyers…\nPrices will evolve as follows:\nDay 0 — At the start of the first day, the price will start at 200,000 MANA\nDay 1 — Throughout the first day, the price will reduce to 100,000 MANA.\nDay 2 — Throughout the second day, the price will reduce to 50,000 MANA.\nDay 3–8 — From the third day through the eighth day, the price will drop 5,000 MANA per day.\nDay 9–15 — From the ninth day through the end of the auction, the price will drop 3,000 MANA per day until a final price of 1,000 MANA is reached.\nHow to take part in the auction?\nHere is a list of the prerequisites for taking part in the auction and having a chance to acquire some LAND:\nKey figures about the second auction\n9,300 LAND for sale in the auction\n15 DAYS of auction\nUp to 1.86 BILLION MANA ($124,620,000) could be spent and burned during the auction if all the LAND were bought at the maximum price of 200,000 MANA. [reminder: all the MANA spent during the auction will be “burned” and will disappear from the global circulation]\nWe have calculated an estimate of MANA that could likely be burned during the auction. We have based our estimation on:\nWe estimate that around 250 to 300 million MANA could likely be burned during this auction.\nAs a reminder, the circulating supply (excluding Decentraland’s wallet) is composed of 1.27 billion MANA, on a total MANA Supply of 2.64 billion. So, between 1/4 and 1/3 of all the circulating MANA could be burned during the second LAND auction.\nGet a head start with NonFungible.com\nDo you prefer to be part of the scrum during the auction or do you prefer to approach the sale with all the necessary information, and an accurate analysis of market trends?\nIn anticipation of this second auction, follow us on Twitter and Medium to hear the latest:\n",

It therefore corresponds to our identity to want to continue to build tools that are always as close as possible to our community, in a community approach.\nThat’s why we asked Low Poly Models for their help to build the best building we could have ever imagined of. And additionally, our friends from DAPPCRAFT created some nice emotes and wearables we’re going to give away during this weekend!\nVisit the NonFungible.com HeadQuarters\nThe NonFungible.com Decentraland headquarters is divided into 5 floors, each with its specialty. Three floors, a ground floor and also, a basement! When you arrive at the entrance, you will be able to find the main information to contact us but also a display area for our sponsors.\nThe first three floors of our HQ are dedicated to the NFT market data and information display. The purpose of these floors is to provide a live integration of the data we offer on site. While the first floor will be reserved for potential sponsors, the next two floors will be dedicated to data display.\nThe rooftop can host conferences, WADA sessions or presentations of the various reports. The goal being to be as inclusive as possible, it will also be a question of hosting Q/A sessions or allowing artists or different projects to come and present their work.\nThe basement also has some surprises in store! We have created an entire space dedicated to education and information in the Web3 ecosystem. Regularly, we will update the articles that can be accessed and why not, maybe one day we will hold courses to know how to set up your community or share some tips for launching your projects?\nA Space to Inform And Share Knowledge Together\nThis space will be our meeting place and meetings with the NFT community. We want it to be open to as many people as possible in order to create a space for exchange and connections.\nWhile 2021 was surprising and incredible, we don’t forget that we’re still building the foundation for tomorrow’s web. What is called the “web3” is not yet precisely defined and it may take a few more years. That’s why we want to continue to encourage NFT experimentation labs like Decentraland and the initiatives that came out of it like DAPPCRAFT Agency or Low Poly Model.\nTo celebrate this event, we’re going to distribute some emotes and wearables for free ! Feel free to join us at the event\nWe hope to see many of you there!\n",

    "content": "Iconic Movie Actor Entering the NFT Space\nSince 2020, we have seen the arrival of many players from the film industry in the NFT space. At that time it had become impossible to meet physically in studios due to lockdowns and NFTs opened up a new way for many artists to continue to express themselves.\nAnthony Hopkins recognized this very quickly and was one of the first of his peers to create a film by integrating NFTs into his creative process! The film Zero Contact was made remotely and the NFT owners could participate in the making of the film. Many NFT initiatives with films have emerged over the past two years, experimenting with new ways of reinventing cinema.\nAfter the collection that was related to the film Zero Contact, Anthony Hopkins decided to go further into the Web3 ecosystem and released The Eternal Collection NFT on October 13th in partnership with Orange Comet.\nOrange Comet Partnership with Sir Anthony Hopkins\nThis is not Orange Comet’s first foray into the NFT space, indeed the company has already partnered with AMC’s The Walking Dead’s NFT collection and recently announced expanded partnership to include Anne Rice’s: Interview With The Vampire television series.\nOn October 13th, it will no longer be a question of cinema but of a new artistic collection with this mint on OpenSea, hosted on Ethereum. Indeed, Anthony Hopkins is not only a film actor but also a painter, with a style that has evolved over the years. Following on with the continuity of his journey towards digital, the artist once again is moving towards NFTs to express his art.\nThis collaboration led to the creation of The Eternal Collection consisting of 1000 unique NFTs.\nThe Eternal NFT Collection\nThe Eternal Collection has been inspired by the different iconic roles Sir Anthony Hopkins has portrayed during his storied career. Included in the NFT collection one will find the ‘Jester,’ ‘Lover,’ ‘Ruler,’ ‘Rebel,’ ‘Giver,’ ‘Hero,’ ‘Explorer,’ ‘Creator,’ ‘Magician,’ and ‘Sage’.\nFor the uniqueness of the creations to be preserved, the supply of the collection is relatively low: only 1000 NFTs will be available for sale. In addition to different levels of rarity, here’s what The Eternal Collection will contain:\nEach of these NFTs are legendary, but the 10 unique 1/1 will allow you to have a Zoom interview with Anthony Hopkins as well as a Dreamscapes Art Book. This art book will allow you to better understand the life and intimacy of the actor through these different visual, written or musical works.\nThe Benefits for Holders\nThis will also be the case for 39 holders of the other 990 legendary works of The Eternal Collection to be drawn at random and will receive the art book. Other benefits await these holders randomly:\nSir Anthony Hopkins has also announced his partnership with Inner-City Arts. In alignment with their mission “to engage young people in the creative process in order to shape a society of creative, confident, and collaborative individuals,” he has pledged a donation from the proceeds of The Eternal Collection to support their cause, quality arts instruction for students from underserved communities, integrated arts workshops for educators, and programming designed for the community through The Rosenthal Theater in Los Angeles.\nFor more information on this unique drop, do not hesitate to check out:\nWebsite – Twitter\n",

    "content": "Blockchain gaming and play to earn are attracting more and more video game development studios around the world. One of the styles of games that adapts to this new style of gameplay is the Role Playing Game (RPG).\nSince every item in the game can be an NFT, it’s natural for players to want to ‘actually own’ their asset. But, the implementation of the blockchain should not come at the expense of the pleasure of playing a game. Lord of Dragons understood this and wants to offer an experience combining both.\nPresentation of Lord of Dragons\nLord of Dragons is the 4th game developed by OnFaceSotem; a subsidiary of OnFaceGames. Since 2018, OnFaceSotem has been developing and producing mobile and desktop video games with different gameplay styles. Among the many games ported by OnFaceSotem, three of them will serve as a reference for Lord of Dragons:\nWith this entertainment-based experience, Lord of Dragons will draw inspiration from the better features of these games to deliver high-quality content. The game will be available everywhere in the world except South Korea.\nTo complete, mechanics of Play to Earn as well as decentralized finance will find their place in this game. There will be NFTs, but also governance tokens to encourage a community dimension to the game.\nPlay, earn and govern\nSeveral elements of play to earn will be found in Lord of Dragons. First of all, the use of NFTs will be implemented, but additionally the game also has its own in-game token as well as a governance token for decisions on the direction of the project.\nLord of Dragons NFTs will be one of the central elements of the game, and will offer several advantages:\nThey will cover the different assets that can be found in theRPG: items, weapons, skins, consumables, lotteries, and much more! Above all, these NFTs can be obtained simply by playing the game. Having a defined supply at launch, they will also make it possible to obtain several benefits over time by remaining an active player!.\nThe game is free to play, downloadable, and can be finished for free. But unlike classic free-to-play, Lord of Dragons will reward players with Lord of Dragons Reward Tokens ($LORT).\nIn addition to serving as an economic basis for the game, the $LORT covers other aspects of the project:\nIt will be possible to complete 10 daily quests in order to earn these prizes as a reward for the efforts spent playing. These quests will have varying difficulties and it will be necessary to complete them to evolve his character and evolve in the game.\nIn addition to the $LORT tokens that will serve for the game economy, there will be the $LOGT that will serve as a governance token. This one will have a much more limited supply and will be granted in reward than to the best players.\nTo obtain this token, you will have to go through an exchange platform or participate in staking tokens. Winning in the game, however, will be more difficult than the $LOGT. Indeed, they have been designed to serve as a reward for the Player vs Player (PVP) as well as the ‘Siege Battle’ game mode.\nDepending on the rank obtained in the ranking, the rewards in $LOGT will be more or less generous.\nWhat are the next steps?\nDeveloping a game takes time, and despite a solid roadmap, there’s much more to come! The first of these concerns security, an audit is underway to be sure that everything is safe for the day the NFTs will be put on sale.\nAlthough there is not yet an announced date for an ICO or IDO, the Lord of Dragon team wants to be listed with Binance NFT within three months maximum. As soon as more information becomes available, the team will communicate it to their community as soon as possible.\nIn the meantime, the game continues to build.

    "content": "The Sandbox has always called itself an open world with a desire to include other projects in its universe and it’s now possible to use many PFP collections as an avatar in this metaverse, which is soon entering its third Alpha phase.\nBuilding The Sandbox never stops!\nThe Sandbox metaverse is an open environment where anyone can participate in its construction. User-generated content (UGC) drives creative activity , whether it’s the monsters, weapons, buildings, or even the quests which players will enjoy.\nThanks to the free VoxEdit tool, it’s possible for anyone, without code, to create their own Sandbox assets and share them with the community. The Game Maker tool allows you to create a whole scene where the player’s adventures can take place.\nWith this focus on its community, The Sandbox has opened the doors of its metaverse even more since the beginning of the year. To participate, simply join the different Alpha Seasons to see and interact with a large part of The Sandbox.\nImporting your avatar to The Sandbox\nIn an increasingly inclusive approach, The Sandbox has begun to integrate other projects into its metaverse. In particular, Profile for Picture (PFP) projects will allow you to use your favorite collection as an avatar in this metaverse!\nFor example, it will be possible to use any NFT from the World of Women collection in The Sandbox. But this is not the only collection involved; others are planned for the third season of the Alpha Season coming this summer:\nThis is a first step towards greater compatibility between NFTs projects, the famous interoperability!\nWhat’s coming next for LAND owners\nPFP collection owners will be able to find additional utility to their NFTs, but on the side of the LAND owners, other news is coming.\nFirst, the migration of LANDs and assets to Polygon. In order to reduce costs as well as its carbon footprint, The Sandbox decided to switch to the Polygon sidechain to host the various assets of the game. One million SAND, the platform’s utility token, was distributed to owners to encourage them to do this migration.\nAs a LAND Owner_ _PLAY ✅ Season 1 – Exclusive NFT Rewards – 11/21 ✅ Season 2 – Earn more $SAND and Raffle Tickets – 2/22 ⏳ Season 3 – Extra Raffle Tickets, Increased Rewards, Special Raffle for LAND Owners only – 7/22 pic.twitter.com/A4y0jQg2BA\nA new token will be created to encourage creators: the EXPERIENCE token. Recognizing the creativity of the community during the various game jams, this new token will reward the community most invested in The Sandbox.\nAnother notable evolution: a community of builders certified to curate the best content created. This brings builders closer to The Sandbox’s goal of opening up decisions about the game to the community.\nMeet The Sandbox community\nSeveral big names and big brands have settled in The Sandbox: The Walking Dead, Snoop Dogg, Adidas, Deadmau5, and Atari are among over 200 companies who are creating experiences in The Sandbox. Thanks to these partnerships, The Sandbox has managed to push the boundaries of its development even further.\nBut the most important thing is the community that participates in the construction of this metaverse every day. In addition to organizing various online events, The Sandbox wants to connect its community in the real world. In addition to always being present at major NFT and crypto events, several gatherings are expected to take place around the world.\nTo learn more about what they are preparing and join the Sandbox family, don’t hesitate to follow them on their different networks:\nWebsite – Twitter – Discord – Youtube\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

It is the first live dynamic and generative NFT of its kind using environmental data gathered in real-time from sensors placed around Gaudi’s infamous Barcelona building.\nDozens of digital artists that are just beginning their journey have had their breakthroughs with the help of NFTs as well. Take Fvckrender, who specializes in colorful geometric-architectural art. The 1,970 NFTs he produced of his “rewiring the brain” piece sold for an average of $4,541 each, making him one of the most successful NFT artists.\nPhotographers are also exploring the opportunities offered by crypto even if they’re not always trading in their original mediums. Smithsonian-featured artist Trey Ratcliff who also runs the world’s #1 travel photography blog in the world released an NFT-edition of Beautiful Cities of the World which comprises a selection of 50 images. But here’s the beauty of crypto: there’s no need to have an established name to succeed.\nGhozali’s Everyday collection is made of 933 self-portraits that Ghozalo of himself between ages 18 and 22 for a school video. He then decided to turn them into NFTs on the OpenSea market. The collection was launched in January 2022 at $3 – however the floor price quickly reached $3000 apiece.\n.ART and the NFT artists community\nLately the community of .ART, the fastest growing domain for creatives that recently celebrated its five-year anniversary, has been joined by hundreds of projects and artists working with crypto and exploring the opportunities offered by web3. Among them are NFT marketplaces such as async.art and meta.art, liquidity pool all.art, the collaborative community with integrated blockchain option dada.art and digital artists like xcopy.art and Pak, who has an ongoing project on burn.art. It is also home to snark.art and og.art, which are offering artists a platform that bridges a gap between traditional and crypto art markets.\nThe evolution of digital services that artists receive from .ART has been fast. You can use .ART as a domain name – to showcase your crypto-related project or NFT collection with a clearly identifiable website name. Moreover, you can use the same domain as a memorable crypto currency wallet address for receiving multiple currencies, tokens or NFTs – thanks to the possibility of integrating it with Ethereum Name Service (ENS).\nCertificate your artwork with .ART Digital Twin\nBack in 2019 .ART presented its Digital Twin product at Apsara Conference, organized annually by the Alibaba Group. With .ART Digital Twin you can create a secure digital certificate of authenticity for your artwork, store information about it and monetize it by using a built-in, no-coding NFT minting solution.\nLeveraging the easy-to-understand technology of domain names and using an international standard for describing cultural objects developed by the J. Paul Getty Trust, Digital Twin by .ART provides a sophisticated but intuitive art object identification tool. The product is currently in its beta version and is being tailored towards the needs of the creative community.\nPartnership with Verisart\nTimed to coincide with NFT.NYC, the premier annual NFT conference, .ART has also teamed up with Verisart, a leading web3 platform where creators mint, sell and connect. Now, Verisart is among the handful of approved apps available in the Shopify NFT Beta Program, which enables Shopify merchants to sell NFTs through a Shopify storefront and accept payment with Shopify Payments.\nThe no-code solution app enables eligible Shopify Plus merchants to easily mint and sell NFTs through their own storefronts and supports different blockchains, collector rewards and minting 1/1s or 10k drops on Ethereum and Polygon. Customers can claim their purchased NFTs from a personalized dashboard in the merchant’s store. .ART’s community will receive a 25% discount on any plan for the Verisart Shopify App and can apply for Shopify’s NFT Beta Program.\nSupporting more creators in their Web3 journey\n“.ART has essentially been built on ideas and strategies that were novel to the domain community.” Said Ulvi Kasimov, Founder of .ART Domains. “As we continue to innovate and conceptualize new products, we are also thrilled to be able to partner with like-minded companies like Verisart that strive to democratize the art market and already have solutions in place to facilitate that.”\nRobert Norton, CEO and co-founder of Verisart, adds: “We are committed to empowering creators with the technology they need to thrive. Our Shopify App makes it easier than ever for merchants to control how their NFTs are sold. By working with the .ART community, we aim to support more creators in their web3 journey.”\nAll in all, venturing into the unknown crypto world can seem quite intimidating. However, doing so with the help of well-established platform such as Shopify, in tandem with art community oriented companies such as Verisart and .ART Domains, is a little less of a challenge – perhaps, it can even be an adventure.\nGet 50% OFF on all .ART domains and launch your journey into crypto.

    "time": "June 14, 2022",
    "content": "Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult (FRWC) launched on June 30, 2021. Less than thirty minutes after launch all 10,000 pixel art Wizards sold out. Less than a year after launch FRWC has summoned attention from beyond its home realm of non-fungible tokens and expanded into traditional media. And at the time of publication FRWC ranks 41st among collectibles available on Ethereum according to our data. What is this phenomenon that has mobilized so many would-be wizards?\nStorytelling, Intellectual Property, and Traditional Media\nSome of the Wizard NFTs feature a pet in addition to the character. Some contain extra visual features like a scythe, and others manage to hold their own heads. All of them call back to 1980s video game art and roleplaying games. FRWC also looks to the future the community can create thanks to the project’s storytelling affordances. These features combine to form what Magic Machine, the project creators, call a ‘legendarium.’ What makes the legendarium different from other projects?\nMagic Machine offer the holder of a Wizard NFT all commercial rights to that NFT. This hybrid intellectual property model allows community members to receive some of the profits from the forthcoming comic book, MMORPG, and television releases. The IP model also occupies a middle ground between Creative Commons (CC0) projects where no-one holds any rights and projects where creators alone possess intellectual property rights.\nFrom the perspective of community and storytelling, Wizard owners have more at stake because they can add value to their Wizards by creating a backstory that’s verifiably theirs, yet within the overall narrative originated by the folks at Magic Machine. Each backstory created is a collaboration with the creators. This dynamic ‘Runiverse’ differs from Web2 fan fiction because authors have greater access to recognition and compensation for their efforts: the blockchain stores an author’s contribution for all to see.\nWhat’s next for Forgotten Runes Wizards’ Cult?\nIn addition to the project’s rapid expansion beyond NFTs, Magic Machine has activated Forgotten Runes Warriors in the runiverse.\nWe’re excited to see what the design studio and community add to the project. What future do you conjure for the runiverse? Feel free to tell us on Discord or Twitter!\n\n",

    "content": "The last time we reported on what was going on in Decentraland was to celebrate the first Metaverse Festival. For several days, hundreds of artists were able to produce exclusive concerts for the metaverse.\nToday, the occasion is Metaverse Fashion Week, Decentraland organized another major event: the first metaverse fashion week! Several big names and luxury brands are exhibiting their latest digital creations and to present the future of wearables in the metaverse.\nGlobal overview of the Decentraland evolution\nBefore presenting the first version of a 3.0 fashion show, let’s take a look back at the latest evolutions of Decentraland. We’ve been able to appreciate the choice between day and night, but other improvements have appeared. The entire user menu interface has been redesigned and it’s now possible to see the different events, your inventory and your contacts even faster.\nBut other elements are interesting to see, including the evolution of the buildings.\nAround the Genesis Plaza, the buildings no longer resemble those that can be easily built from the Decentraland Builder. Several professions have developed during 2021, including metaverse architect. The result is very telling, all the buildings of the official projects (such as Kraken, Known Origin, Coca Cola or SuperRare) have all created particular 3D designs.\nThe Aquarium: a Decentralized Casino\nDuring our visit, one of Decentraland’s interactive activities are its casinos. One of many casinos in Decentraland is called The Aquarium and offers you the ability to play Roulette or Black Jack while participating with other players.\nHere, the currency to play is the FREE, a token that cannot be exchanged. The only way to win is to stay in the casino area in order to receive it for free. Of course, it’s also possible to earn FREE by playing the different games.\nRegularly, as with the other casinos several tournaments are held to allow participants to win prizes such as Decentral Games NFTs or sometimes crypto rewards.\nMetaverse Fashion Week\nThis event is one of the first of its kind in Decentraland. Combining a conference of well-known personalities of this industry and an exhibition, Metaverse Fashion Week echoes the event that travels to cities around the world every year.\nIn the different floors of the buildings reserved for the event, it is possible to recognize well-known names such as Kark Lagarfeld who made an NFT drop last year.\nBut when we go upstairs, other names and works await us. The Vogue Foundation, the artist Ourobouros or Kid Super… so many exhibited works that make it possible to highlight what announces a future trend in virtual worlds: the personalization of your avatar.\nSeveral unique pieces are on sale to the public for the duration of the event, auguring for the future of a dedicated fashion store in Decentraland?\nMore Events and Experiences to Come\nWith the impressive evolution of the NFT ecosystem in 2021, the number of experiences and events related to major real-world brands will surely continue to be implemented in the future.\nSotheby’s already has its own building to organize auctions, all crypto exchanges also have theirs and bought an estate to install an entire shopping center.\nThis kind of signal suggests that if last year was the year of investments for all these players, the coming years will be the year of project development for new investors and the public!\n",
