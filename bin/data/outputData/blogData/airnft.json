    "content": "The rise of digital media and online platforms has created new ways for artists to earn a living. In the past, royalties have been a major source of income for creators, providing them with ongoing compensation for their work. NFT creator royalties are a new tool that allows artists to earn passive income from their digital content.\nThere is a growing debate in the Web3 community about whether collectors should pay royalties to creators. This guide compares NFT marketplaces that pay royalties to creators with those that don\u0027t.\nNFT Marketplaces that Fully Support NFT Creator Royalties\nBy allowing creators to set royalties on their NFTs, these platforms ensure that creators continue to earn money even after their work has been sold. Some of the most popular platforms that support creator royalties include:\n1. Nifty Gateway\nRenowned as a premier NFT marketplace, Nifty Gateway stands as an ideal platform for art enthusiasts, including artists and established brands. The platform holds the conviction that secondary market fees contribute to the unique value proposition of NFTs. Nifty Gateway ensures enforceable royalties on a platform level, while simultaneously respecting on-chain royalties established by creators.\n2. Foundation\nEstablished in 2022, Foundation has risen to become a prominent NFT marketplace. Distinguished by its invitation-only approach for creators, the platform imposes a substantial 5% marketplace fee on all transactions, encompassing both primary and secondary sales. Despite this, creators benefit from a remarkable 10% royalty on all secondary sales.\n3. X2Y2\nX2Y2, launched in January 2022, initially held a stance against creator royalties. However, the platform reversed its position a few months later, now wholeheartedly endorsing and honoring creator royalties on all collections.\n4. Rarible\nWith its inception dating back to 2019, Rarible is an esteemed NFT marketplace celebrated for its Ethereum-based collectibles. The platform prides itself in adhering to on-chain royalties, empowering users to establish their own royalty parameters.\nBalanced Approaches to NFT Creator Royalties\nAmid the ongoing debate surrounding NFT royalties, certain platforms have chosen a middle ground, providing alternative mechanisms for compensating creators. These marketplaces present optional royalties with token minimum fees for existing collections or employ alternative compensation methods. Notable platforms in this category include:\n1. OpenSea\nDebuting in 2017, OpenSea stands as the first and largest NFT marketplace, offering diverse digital art and music options. The platform temporarily reduced its transaction fee in response to market dynamics and now presents a flexible approach to optional royalties. NFT projects lacking on-chain enforcement mandate a modest royalty fee of 0.5%, accommodating varying perceptions of NFT value. OpenSea also introduces enforceable royalty models for new collections, promoting adherence to royalty terms.\n2. Blur\nLaunched in October 2022, Blur has swiftly become a prominent Ethereum-based NFT marketplace due to its speed and innovative features. Blur harmonizes optional creator royalties, incorporating a minimum fee of 0.5% for immutable collections unable to utilize the filter registry.\n3. LooksRare\nEmerging in January 2022, LooksRare positioned itself as a significant rival to OpenSea. The platform initially embraced standard creator royalties but later opted to allow buyers to determine their royalty preference at checkout. Moreover, LooksRare commits 25% of protocol fees to creators, thus maintaining a symbiotic relationship.\nNFT Marketplaces That Don’t Support NFT Creator Royalties\nThroughout 2022, several NFT marketplaces discontinued their support for creator-set royalties, spurred by differing perspectives within the NFT ecosystem. While creator royalties benefit creators significantly, the same might not hold true for collectors. Noteworthy platforms not supporting creator royalties include:\n1. Magic Eden\nInitially introduced on Solana blockchain, Magic Eden expanded its presence to other blockchains. While the platform initially advocated for creator royalties, it backed out later and transitioned to an optional model. Under this new paradigm, buyers determine the percentage of royalties, shifting the dynamic away from creators.\n2. Sudoswap\nEstablished in May 2022, Sudoswap is a decentralized NFT marketplace offering a unique trading environment via liquidity pools. Despite its innovative approach, Sudoswap does not incorporate creator royalties within its framework.\n3. Solanart\nFounded on Solana blockchain in June 2021, Solanart emerged as a popular Solana NFT marketplace. The platform initially embraced a fee-based model with customizable royalties for creators. However, it pivoted to eliminating all fees, subsequently forfeiting support for creator royalties.\n4. Yawww\nOriginally conceived as a peer-to-peer NFT lending platform, Yawww transformed into a community-owned marketplace. By placing the decision-making power of royalty percentages in the hands of buyers, Yawww diverged from the traditional model of supporting creator royalties.\nClosing thoughts: Pondering the Path Forward for NFT Creator Royalties\nThe NFT community grapples with the ongoing debate surrounding the prominence of creator royalties within major marketplaces and collections. NFT creator royalties were a breakthrough that allowed artists to profit from their work. Before NFTs, artists had little control over how their work was distributed or sold. NFTs gave artists the ability to embed royalty payments into their work, so they would receive a cut of the proceeds from any future sales. This was a major breakthrough that helped to level the playing field for artists and gave them a greater share of the profits from their work.\nAs platforms prioritize creators\u0027 interests over collectors\u0027, the enduring relevance of royalties in NFT sales prevails.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a groundbreaking innovation in the ever-evolving landscape of digital art and collectibles, transforming how creators monetize their work. Central to this revolution is the concept of NFT royalties—a mechanism that allows creators to continue profiting from their art even after its initial sale.\nIn this guide, we explore the fundamentals of NFT royalties, exploring how they work, benefits, setup methods, tracking procedures, and dispute resolution strategies.\nWhat are NFT royalties?\nNFT royalties are a way for creators to earn long-term passive income from their work, even after the initial sale of the NFT. When an NFT is created, the creator can set a royalty percentage, which is the amount of money they will receive from each subsequent sale of the NFT. This means that the creator can continue to earn money from their work for years to come.\nNFT royalties are a powerful tool for creators, as they can help them to protect their intellectual property and ensure that they are fairly compensated for their work.\nHow NFT Royalties Work\nAt the heart of NFT royalties lies the ingenious application of blockchain technology. When an NFT is minted, its smart contract can be programmed to automatically allocate a percentage of any future resale value to the original creator. This programming ensures that creators receive their due share every time the NFT changes hands, be it once or a hundred times.\nThe calculation and distribution of royalty payments are baked into the very code of the NFT. When a secondary sale occurs, the smart contract triggers the transfer of the predefined percentage to the creator\u0027s wallet, ensuring an equitable distribution of profits between creators and collectors.\nThere are two primary types of NFT royalties: fixed royalties and percentage royalties. A fixed royalty entails a fixed monetary amount paid to the creator on each resale, while a percentage royalty allocates a specific percentage of the resale price. This flexibility empowers creators to choose the royalty model that aligns best with their creative and financial goals.\nBenefits of NFT Royalties\nHow to Set Up NFT Royalties\nThe process of implementing NFT royalties varies across platforms, each with its own nuances. Here are some popular methods:\nHow to Avoid Disputes over NFT Royalties\nAs you embark on your NFT journey, remember that setting up royalties is more than just a financial strategy—it\u0027s a step towards reshaping the landscape of creative ownership.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "NFT Gaming: The Future of the Gaming Industry",
    "content": "The gaming industry is rapidly evolving, and blockchain technology is playing a major role in this transformation. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are becoming increasingly popular in gaming, as they offer a way for players to truly own in-game assets. This ownership is recorded on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.\nIn this blog post, we will explore the future of NFT gaming. We will discuss the latest trends in NFT gaming, the challenges and opportunities facing the industry, and how NFTs are changing the way we play games.\nWhat are NFTs?\nNFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that cannot be replicated. They are stored on a blockchain, which is a secure and transparent ledger that records transactions. NFTs can represent anything from digital art and collectibles to in-game items and virtual real estate.\nHow are NFTs being used in gaming?\nNFTs are being used in gaming in a variety of ways. One of the most popular ways is to represent in-game items. This could include anything from weapons and armor to skins and pets. When an in-game item is represented by an NFT, it becomes truly owned by the player. This means that the player can trade or sell the item on a secondary market, or even take it with them to other games that support NFTs.\nAnother way that NFTs are being used in gaming is to create play-to-earn games. In these games, players can earn NFTs or tokens by completing in-game tasks. These tokens can then be redeemed for real-world currency. Play-to-earn games offer a new way for players to earn money while having fun (more about this in the next section).\nLatest trends in NFT gaming\n1. Play-to-Earn Games\nPlay-to-earn (P2E) games are a new and exciting trend in the gaming industry. These games allow players to earn real-world money by playing the game. Players can earn money by completing in-game tasks, such as battling other players, completing quests, or collecting items. The money that players earn can be used to buy in-game items, withdraw to a crypto wallet, or even be used to pay for real-world expenses.\nP2E games are still in their early stages, but they have the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry. They offer a new way for players to earn money, and they can also provide a sense of ownership and community.\nP2E games use blockchain technology to track the ownership of in-game assets. This means that players can actually own the items that they earn in the game. These items can then be traded or sold on NFT marketplaces. This novel approach transforms gaming from a mere pastime into a potential source of income.\nThere are also some challenges associated with P2E games, including:\n2. Virtual Worlds: Bridging Realities with NFTs\nVirtual worlds are immersive digital environments that allow players to create, explore, and socialize. They are powered by blockchain technology, which allows players to own the in-game assets that they create or acquire. This ownership is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.\nVirtual worlds are using NFTs to enhance player experiences in a number of ways. For example, NFTs can be used to represent:\nThis ownership extends beyond aesthetics, as players can monetize their creations. For example, players can sell their virtual land or assets to other players, or they can rent them out for a fee. This blurring of the line between player and creator is one of the most exciting aspects of virtual worlds powered by NFTs.\nVirtual worlds powered by NFTs also face a number of challenges, including:\nChallenges and Opportunities in NFT Gaming\nThe NFT gaming industry is rapidly growing, but it also faces a number of challenges and opportunities.\nConclusion\nThe future of NFT gaming is bright, but it is important to be aware of the challenges and opportunities that the industry faces. By addressing these challenges and seizing the opportunities, the NFT gaming industry could revolutionize the way we play games.\nCreate your first game asset as an NFT with AirNFTs, the NFT marketplace for esports gamers. Mint game assets just under the $1, our platform works with BSC, Matic and ETH blockchains.\nWith AirNFTs, you’re in control of your GameFi NFTs. Earn with your Game assets now!\nFollow us on\nBlockchain games like Axie Infinity allow you to buy and sell objects, land, and characters in the game. This works just like blockchains and NFTs, meaning you can profit by minting your character or a series of characters as NFTs.\nIf you want to get started with play-to-earn games, you\u0027ll need a crypto wallet. This will allow you to connect to the game and purchase NFTs. Try popular wallets such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask.\nScammers behind NFT scam games usually plan and execute their schemes on a grand scale. They often target novice investors instead of experts and use attractive websites and advertisements to entice inexperienced users.\nNFT games are generally accessed via PC, but most already provide NFT game platforms that can be accessed using other devices, such as iOS and Android.\nPlay-to-earn and NFT games strive to establish a gaming ecosystem that prioritizes players by granting them ownership of their in-game assets and providing rewards for their engagement in gaming activities.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "In today\u0027s rapidly evolving digital landscape, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a game-changing technology. NFTs are unique digital assets that leverage blockchain technology to establish verifiable ownership of digital and physical items. Businesses are harnessing the power of NFTs to transform various aspects of their operations, from ownership verification to customer engagement and revenue generation.\nHow NFTs are used by businesses today\n1. Verifiable Ownership and Authenticity\nNFTs offer a robust solution for creating verifiable records of ownership, especially for digital assets, such as artwork, music, and videos. This can help to prevent counterfeiting and fraud, and it can also help to ensure that artists and creators are properly compensated for their work, thanks to the transparent and immutable nature of blockchain transactions.\n2.

This can help to prevent theft and counterfeiting, and it can also improve supply chain management.\n3. Rewarding Customer Loyalty\nBusinesses are using NFTs to cultivate customer loyalty by offering exclusive content, discounts, and other perks through tokenized rewards. By providing unique NFT-based incentives, companies create a sense of belonging and encourage repeat business. This strategy not only builds strong customer relationships but also generates excitement and buzz around the brand, amplifying its presence in the market.\n4. Crafting Unique Experiences\nNFTs can be used to create unique experiences for customers, such as access to exclusive events, virtual worlds, and interactive games. This can help businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors and to attract new customers.\n5. Diversifying Revenue Streams\nIn a world marked by economic uncertainty, NFTs offer businesses an avenue to diversify their revenue streams. By selling NFTs of digital assets, event tickets, and other unique experiences, companies tap into an entirely new market. This diversification enhances business resilience against economic downturns.\nConclusion\nNFTs are reshaping the business landscape in unprecedented ways. The potential of NFTs to revolutionize traditional operations and revenue models is immense. As technology continues to advance, businesses are encouraged to explore and leverage NFTs to unlock new dimensions of success and innovation.\nEmbrace the NFT revolution and reimagine the possibilities for your business\u0027s growth and sustainability.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "What Makes NFTs Valuable? 5 Factors Influencing NFT Prices",
    "content": "The prices of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) can vary significantly, with some reaching astronomical figures. Numerous factors contribute to the valuation of NFTs, and understanding these factors is essential for both collectors and investors in the NFT market. We will explore 5 key elements that influence the prices of NFTs and contribute to their perceived value.\n1. The Significance of the Creator or Artist\nOne of the primary factors influencing the value of an NFT is the reputation and significance of the creator or artist behind it. As in traditional art, renowned artists often command higher prices for their works. Collectors and enthusiasts are willing to pay a premium for NFTs created by well-established artists, as these pieces often carry a certain prestige and historical significance.\nAn artist\u0027s track record and previous sales history can also impact the value of their NFTs. Artists with a proven record of successful sales or gained recognition through high-profile collaborations and exhibitions are more likely to attract higher bids and achieve greater value for their NFTs. The reputation and influence of the creator play a significant role in determining the perceived value of an NFT.\n2. Rarity and Limited Editions\nScarcity and limited availability are crucial factors in NFT valuation. The concept of rarity is deeply ingrained in collectibles, and NFTs are no exception. NFTs that are part of limited editions or have a low total supply are often highly sought after by collectors. The scarcity of these NFTs creates a sense of exclusivity and adds to their perceived value.\nArtists and creators can leverage scarcity by minting NFTs in limited quantities or offering unique pieces. Limited editions can range from a few copies to a set number determined by the artist. The fewer available copies, the higher the demand and potential value of the NFT. Collectors are often willing to pay a premium for the opportunity to own a rare and exclusive piece.\n3. Demand and Popularity among Collectors\nThe level of demand and the overall popularity of an NFT heavily influence its price. NFTs that capture the attention and interest of a broader audience are more likely to command higher prices. The demand for an NFT can be driven by various factors, such as the artist\u0027s reputation, the uniqueness of the artwork or collectible, and the overall trend and sentiment in the market.\nPopularity among collectors can create a bidding war, driving up the prices of NFTs. When multiple individuals are vying for the same NFT, the price can skyrocket as each participant tries to outbid the others. The concept of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) often plays a role in driving demand, as collectors want to take advantage of the opportunity to own a highly sought-after NFT.\n4. Utility and Functionality of NFTs\nWhile art and collectibles dominate the NFT market, the utility and functionality of NFTs can also impact their value. NFTs that offer additional benefits or provide access to exclusive content, experiences, or events can attract higher prices. For example, an NFT representing a virtual real estate property in a metaverse may come with the ability to generate income or participate in virtual events, making it more valuable to collectors.\nIntegrating NFTs into various digital platforms and ecosystems can also contribute to their value. NFTs that can be used within specific applications, games, or virtual worlds hold utility beyond their pure aesthetic or collectible value. The potential for practical use cases and the ability to interact with NFTs meaningfully can drive up their perceived value and demand.\n5. Historical Significance and Cultural Relevance\nNFTs that hold historical significance or carry cultural relevance often garner higher valuations. These NFTs capture a moment or represent a significant event or milestone. Examples include NFTs commemorating a groundbreaking artwork, an iconic sports moment, or a cultural phenomenon. Collectors who value these historical and cultural artifacts are willing to pay a premium for their ownership, contributing to their high prices.\nThe cultural impact and relevance of an NFT can also influence its value. NFTs that resonate with current trends, social movements, or popular culture have the potential to attract a wider audience and generate intense interest.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe ability of an NFT to evoke strong emotions, spark conversations, or represent a larger cultural narrative can drive up its perceived value and make it highly sought after. Scarcity, authenticity, rarity, creator reputation, cultural significance, utility, and historical significance are all essential factors that can impact the value of an NFT. Understanding these factors can help collectors make informed decisions when investing in NFTs.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "The realm of Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has taken the investment world by storm, and within it, art has emerged as a frontrunner. Unlike traditional art investing, which has been limited to the wealthy elite, NFTs have democratized art ownership, allowing enthusiasts from all walks of life to partake in this exciting space. In this article, we will explore the fascinating landscape of NFT art, providing you with an insider\u0027s view of the top NFT art pieces you can invest in this year.\nUnderstanding NFT Art\nNFT-based art comes in various forms, from digital paintings and photographs to mesmerizing videos, musical compositions, and even video games. Essentially, anything you can imagine as digital art, including converted physical art, can be transformed into an NFT.\nHow NFT Art Works\nThe beauty of NFT art lies in its simplicity. Anyone can create an NFT from their creative work and offer it for sale on numerous NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs. As an NFT collector, you gain exclusive ownership rights to the digital creation, and in some cases, even earn royalties from its future use by others online.\nMuch like traditional art investing, the value of NFT art is a subjective and intricate matter. It depends on factors such as the artist\u0027s reputation, the rarity and uniqueness of the artwork, demand, and the price art enthusiasts are willing to pay for it. The exciting difference, however, lies in the ability to monitor the value of NFT art in real-time, as it can be actively traded and displayed on NFT marketplaces.\n6 Unmissable NFT Art Opportunities for 2023\n1. CryptoPunks: Crafted by Larva Labs, CryptoPunks stands as an early triumph in the NFT art world. Consisting of 10,000 distinct pixelated portraits, this Ethereum-based collection was originally distributed for free in 2017. Now, these pixel masterpieces command staggering prices, with some selling for millions of dollars.\n2. Beeple: Renowned artist Mike Winkelman, also known as Beeple, has taken the NFT art scene by storm. His piece titled \"Everydays: The First 5,000 Days\" auctioned for a jaw-dropping $69 million, catapulting NFT art into the mainstream. With his daily digital art tradition spanning over 13 years, Beeple\u0027s latest works continue to fetch significant sums.\n3. Pak: An anonymous digital artist or team, Pak, has made waves in the NFT community. Their work \"The Merge\" surpassed Beeple\u0027s record, selling for $91.8 million on Nifty Gateway. Notably, proceeds from the sale of \"Clock\" were dedicated to supporting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\u0027s legal defense.\n4. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC): This collection features 10,000 comic book-style portraits of apes, each doubling as a digital membership card granting access to a virtual world created for these characters. Although sold out, BAYC NFTs can be acquired through NFT marketplaces, with the most valuable pieces fetching millions of dollars.\n5. Axie Infinity: More than just art, Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based video game powered by Ethereum.

Let’s explore further about them together.\nLayer Zero enables cross-chain applications through an inter-chain communication protocol on Omnichain. It connects different blockchain networks, allowing applications to rent infrastructures from other chains securely.\nTo improve your chances of receiving a Layer Zero airdrop, engage with projects on Layer Zero such as Stargate. Provide liquidity, stake STG tokens, vote on DAO proposals, or use the Aptos bridge powered by Layer Zero.\nzkSync is a Layer 2 solution that offers a faster and more efficient Ethereum experience. It utilizes a modified ZK-rollup and aims to provide cutting-edge performance through the Opportunity protocol and HyperChains.\nAn airdrop is likely for zkSync as they plan to release a token for their network to support ecosystem growth. To improve eligibility, try out zkSync\u0027s products and applications, participate in the zkSync2.0 testnet, and use zkSync 1.0.\nInteract with the zkSync ecosystem and deposit liquidity on the network to enhance your chances of receiving a potential zkSync airdrop.\nStarknet is a zero-knowledge Layer 2 that integrates account abstraction, enabling new ways to interact with dApps. A Starknet token release is anticipated, and to increase your eligibility, install the Starknet wallet Argent X, bridge funds into Starknet, and interact with live dApps.\nScroll is another zero-knowledge Layer 2 that addresses MEVs and fosters partnerships between dApps. A potential Scroll token release is expected. To improve eligibility, join the Scroll Alpha Testnet, participate in the testnet, interact with Scroll\u0027s version of Uniswap, and explore other dApps.\nLens Protocol is a next-generation Social-Fi platform that is both permissionless and non-custodial. While there is no official announcement for a Lens Protocol token airdrop, you you will most likely need a Lens profile in order to get a potential Lens Protocol airdrop because you will need to interact with their ecosystem. Here’s how to receive a potential Lens Protocol airdrop:\nNote: We do not endorse any of these projects. Users are advised to conduct their own research before engaging in any airdrop hunt.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "The Pros and Cons of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)",
    "content": "In recent years, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the digital world by storm. From artwork to music, collectibles to virtual real estate, NFTs have transformed how we perceive ownership and value in the digital realm. However, like any new technology, NFTs come with their own set of pros and cons. In this article, we will dive into the benefits and controversies surrounding non-fungible tokens, providing a balanced perspective on their impact.\nThe Pros of NFTs\nOne of the most significant advantages of NFTs is their ability to establish digital ownership and authenticity. Unlike traditional digital files that can be easily copied or duplicated, NFTs are unique and cannot be replicated. Each NFT contains a digital signature that verifies its authenticity and proves ownership. This groundbreaking feature has opened up new possibilities for artists, creators, and collectors, enabling them to sell and trade digital assets securely.\nNFTs have empowered artists and creators, allowing them to monetize their digital creations directly. In the past, artists often struggled to receive fair compensation for their work in the digital space. With NFTs, artists can retain full control over their creations, set their own prices, and receive a percentage of subsequent sales. This new revenue model has the potential to revolutionize the art industry, providing artists with more financial stability and creative freedom.\nNFTs have expanded beyond the digital realm, enabling the tokenization of real-world assets. This has opened up new avenues for fractional ownership and investment. For example, individuals can now own a percentage of a physical artwork, real estate property, or even a vintage car through NFTs. This democratization of asset ownership allows individuals with limited resources to participate in markets that were previously inaccessible.\nUnlike traditional art sales, where artists often receive a one-time payment, NFTs enable artists to earn royalties on secondary sales. This means that artists can continue to receive a percentage of the sale price each time their NFT is resold. This concept of residual income has the potential to provide long-term financial stability for artists, ensuring they are fairly compensated for the continued value their creations generate.\nThe Controversies Surrounding NFTs\nOne of the most significant controversies surrounding NFTs is their environmental impact. The process of minting NFTs involves complex computations and relies heavily on blockchain technology, which consumes a considerable amount of energy. Critics argue that the carbon footprint associated with NFTs is substantial and contributes to climate change. As the popularity of NFTs continues to grow, it is crucial to explore more sustainable alternatives to mitigate their environmental impact.\nThe popularity of NFTs has led to a speculative market, with some individuals buying NFTs solely as an investment, hoping for exponential returns. Critics argue that this speculation has created a bubble, and the value of certain NFTs may not be sustainable in the long term. Additionally, the potential for fraud and scams in the NFT market raises concerns about investor protection and market regulation.\nWhile NFTs have provided opportunities for artists and creators, they have also raised questions of exclusivity and accessibility. The high costs associated with minting and purchasing NFTs can make it difficult for emerging artists and individuals with limited financial means to participate fully. This raises concerns about whether NFTs will primarily benefit established artists and collectors, further widening the gap between the haves and have-nots in the art world.\nThe digital nature of NFTs has raised concerns about copyright and intellectual property rights. As NFTs can be created and sold by anyone, it becomes challenging to verify the original creator and ensure proper attribution.

It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "If you\u0027re a music lover and an investor, you may have heard of music NFTs. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have been making headlines in the art world, but they are also gaining popularity in the music industry. In this beginner\u0027s guide, we\u0027ll explain what music NFTs are, how they work, and how you can invest in them.\nWhat are Music NFTs?\nA music NFT is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of a piece of music. It\u0027s a way for musicians and creators to sell their music as a one-of-a-kind digital asset that can be bought and sold like any other collectible. Music NFTs can include anything from a single track to an entire album, and they can be sold on various NFT marketplaces.\nHow do Music NFTs Work?\nMusic NFTs are created on blockchain technology, which means that they are stored on a decentralized ledger that cannot be altered or duplicated. Each music NFT has a unique identification code that verifies its authenticity and ownership. When you purchase a music NFT, you are essentially buying the rights to that piece of music, and you can sell it to someone else in the future if you choose.\nHow to Invest in Music NFTs?\nInvesting in music NFTs is similar to investing in any other type of collectible. You\u0027ll need to do your research to find out which musicians and creators are selling music NFTs and what their track record is. You can also check NFT marketplaces like AirNFTs, OpenSea, Rarible, and Nifty Gateway to see what\u0027s available.\nWhen you\u0027re ready to invest, you\u0027ll need to purchase some cryptocurrency, as most music NFTs are sold on blockchain-based marketplaces that require crypto as payment. Once you have your cryptocurrency, you can use it to purchase the music NFT of your choice.\nRisks of Investing in Music NFTs\nLike any investment, there are risks associated with investing in music NFTs. The value of a music NFT can fluctuate based on various factors, such as the popularity of the musician or creator, the demand for the music, and the overall market conditions. Additionally, there is the risk that the music NFT market could become oversaturated, which could lead to a decrease in value.\nConclusion\nInvesting in music NFTs can be an exciting way to support your favorite musicians and creators while potentially earning a profit. However, it\u0027s important to do your due diligence and understand the risks before diving in. As with any investment, it\u0027s wise to start small and gradually increase your investment as you become more familiar with the market.\nStart earning with music NFTs today!\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "What are Ethereum Inscriptions? Ethscriptions Explained",
    "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of Web3 technologies, Ethereum Inscriptions, more commonly known as Ethscriptions, have emerged as a groundbreaking protocol. Ethereum Inscriptions follow the significant impact of Bitcoin Ordinals Inscriptions, which revolutionized the web3 space by introducing the Ordinals protocol in January 2023. The success of Ordinals has inspired numerous established projects to expand their presence beyond Ethereum and Solana, venturing into Bitcoin.\nBuilding upon the influence of Ordinals, Ethscriptions have come into existence – enabling the creation and sharing of digital entities on the Ethereum blockchain, provided they stay within the 96-kilobyte size limit.\nSince its introduction in June 2023, Ethscriptions have captivated the attention of developers, crypto enthusiasts, and investors alike. This blog post explores the basics of Ethscriptions, their functionality, and the prospects they hold.\nWhat are Ethscriptions?\nEthereum Inscriptions, or Ethscriptions, are basically Ethereum’s response to Bitcoin’s Ordinals Inscriptions, offering a unique approach to creating and distributing digital artifacts on the blockchain. Each Ethscription is a unique data URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), ensuring originality and ownership changes based on transaction input data.\nHow Do Ethscriptions Work?\nEthscriptions harness the power of Ethereum blockchain to enable the creation and sharing of digital entities. Unlike traditional financial transactions, Ethscriptions focus on inscribing non-financial data directly onto the Ethereum main chain, utilizing Ethereum \"calldata\" to facilitate communication between entities and smart contracts. This innovative approach not only provides a decentralized alternative to contract storage but also offers affordability, accessibility, and security.\nCreated by Tom Lehman, co-founder of Genius.com, the innovation has sparked considerable interest since its June 17 launch, with over 130,000 Ethscriptions generated to date. To add to the excitement, Lehman also introduced Ethereum Punks, a collection consisting of 10,000 Punks that were all claimed within hours.\nThe Inner Workings of Ethscriptions\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Ethscriptions, it is essential to explore their operational mechanisms. Ethscriptions come to life with the successful execution of an Ethereum transaction, wherein the input data forms a valid data URI. It is important to note that the input data, interpreted as UTF-8, must be unique to ensure content integrity. Ethscriptions currently support all valid mimetypes and guarantee uniqueness by ensuring no prior block or transaction within the same block possesses identical content.\nMoreover, Ethscriptions can be transferred through Ethereum transactions as long as the data represents the transaction hash of a valid Ethscription and the sender holds rightful ownership. While images are the primary form of Ethscriptions presently, Tom Lehman, the mastermind behind Ethscriptions, has hinted at expanding the protocol to include diverse data types in the future.\nEthscriptions: A Promising Frontier in the Web3 Space\nTom Lehman\u0027s brainchild, Ethscriptions, holds immense potential for revolutionizing Web3. In a recent tweet, Lehman emphasized the affordability and decentralized nature of Ethscriptions, highlighting their ability to unlock Ethereum\u0027s full potential. This vision has resonated strongly within the Web3 community, with many eagerly awaiting the impact Ethscriptions will have on the ecosystem. While some critics have raised questions about the novelty of the protocol, and whether Ethscriptions will see the same success as Ordinals, Lehman remains undeterred and committed to enhancing Ethscriptions as a foundation for future innovations.\nIn conclusion, Ethscriptions have emerged as a groundbreaking protocol within the Web3 space. Their ability to inscribe non-financial data directly onto the Ethereum main chain, coupled with a balance between affordability and decentralization, positions Ethscriptions as a significant development in the crypto realm. As the protocol evolves and diversifies its offerings, it can transform how we interact with and exchange digital entities. The journey of Ethscriptions has only just begun, and their exciting future promises to reshape the Ethereum landscape.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "What are BRC-20 Tokens? A Beginner Guide",
    "content": "While blockchain technology keeps bringing innovations every other day, the latest talk of the town is BRC-20, or Bitcoin Request for Comment 20.\nCan Bitcoin evolve beyond being a digital store of value and unlock new advanced functionalities? A fascinating experiment pushes the boundaries by introducing native fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. The BRC-20 protocol. BRC-20 is an innovative experimental token standard that cleverly overcomes Bitcoin\u0027s programmability limitations, paving the way for creating semi-fungible tokens through ordinal inscriptions.\nThis article takes a closer look at BRC-20 tokens, comprehensively exploring their mechanics and contemplating their potential as a standardized token system within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nWhat is the BRC-20 Protocol?\nIn March 2023, an anonymous developer named Domo proposed Bitcoin Request for Comment 20 (BRC-20), drawing inspiration from Ethereum\u0027s widely adopted ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comment 20) token standard.\nBRC-20 serves as a token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging ordinal inscriptions to facilitate the minting and transfer of fungible tokens.\nToken standards establish the rules governing the behavior of tokens within a blockchain ecosystem. For example, ERC-20 defines the guidelines for creating ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.\nBitcoin was initially conceived as a peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized currency without the ability to execute smart contracts or host decentralized applications (DApps). However, the introduction of the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in 2021 ushered in a new era by enabling the attachment of additional data onto Bitcoin block space through the ordinal protocol. Ordinals is a Bitcoin protocol launched in January 2023 – leading to the emergence of Bitcoin NFTs and the development of the BRC-20 token standard. The ordinal protocol assigns a unique serial number, or ordinal, to each satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) and includes this data within Bitcoin transactions.\nBRC-20 tokens leverage JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) embedded into ordinal inscriptions to define and initialize the functionality of token smart contracts. This innovation empowers users to deploy, mint, and transfer tokens seamlessly on the Bitcoin network.\nBy adopting the BRC-20 standard, Bitcoin expands its capabilities beyond its original design, embracing the exciting realm of tokenization and opening new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain applications.\nHow do BRC-20 tokens work?\nBRC-20 tokens, although considered fungible, have some unique characteristics that make them semi-fungible. Here\u0027s how they operate:\nWhen exchanging BRC-20 tokens natively on the Bitcoin network:\nTo check the balance of BRC-20 tokens in a wallet:\nBy understanding these key aspects of BRC-20 tokens, users can effectively navigate the process of minting, exchanging, and tracking their BRC-20 token balances on the Bitcoin network.\nWhat is the difference between BRC-20 and ERC-20 tokens?\nThe Ethereum ERC-20 and Bitcoin BRC-20 token standards are used in different blockchain ecosystems, though the former is said to have inspired the latter. ERC-20 is the primary token standard on the Ethereum blockchain, while BRC-20 is a new (experimental) token standard introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain in 2023.\nERC-20 tokens enable the use of smart contracts on Ethereum, allowing tokens to automatically execute agreements when specific conditions are met. They are widely used for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum, where each token has the same value and can be exchanged directly. Many cryptocurrencies use the ERC-20 standard, including: Shiba Inu, Tether, USD Coin, UniSwap, BNB Coin, Wrapped Bitcoin.\nBRC-20 tokens, on the other hand, are based on the Ordinals protocol and allow developers to create tokens on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Ordinals protocol addresses another limitation experienced by the Bitcoin blockchain: its inability to host non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and enables the creation of fungible assets on Bitcoin.\nWhile ERC-20 tokens have been established for a longer time and have many tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain, BRC-20 tokens are still in their early stages of development. Some of the top BRC-20 tokens include ORDI (the first BRC20 token), PEPE, MEME, PIZA, and RARE, but their demand and value still need to be well-established.\nWhat are the use cases of BRC-20 tokens?\nBRC-20 tokens serve various use cases:\nUsers can utilize BRC-20 tokens for peer-to-peer transactions between wallets on the network. Since BRC-20 tokens are based on Bitcoin, transaction fees are charged in Bitcoin.\nWith further development, BRC-20 tokens can be used to create crypto assets that are pegged to other commodities such as fiat currency or gold. Users can use JSON code to define token characteristics and properties, including supply, minting, and issuance mechanisms through ordinal inscriptions.\nBRC-20 tokens present an opportunity to enhance the growth and liquidity of the Bitcoin blockchain. By integrating additional features, these tokens can be incorporated into DeFi exchanges, yield farming protocols, and GameFi applications.\nThese are some of the potential use cases for BRC-20 tokens, which may evolve as the standard and ecosystem continue to develop.\nWhere can I trade BRC-20 tokens?\nBRC-20 tokens can be traded in two ways:\nConclusion\nBRC-20 tokens are currently in their experimental stages and might face challenges ahead.\nHowever, with continued development and integrations, BRC-20s hold the potential to unlock new opportunities for DeFi projects and decentralized applications (DApps) within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Traders and investors are encouraged to carefully monitor market liquidity, diversify their portfolios, and employ adequate risk management strategies.\nKeep an eye on our blog to stay informed about the latest developments in the blockchain and NFT space.\nFollow us on\nThe introduction of the BRC-20 token has brought forth numerous possibilities for Bitcoin\u0027s layer-2 solutions and scaling mechanisms. Moreover, it has sparked a significant rise in network demand, increasing revenue for Bitcoin miners, which has not been observed since 2017.\nYou can explore options such as the Xverse Wallet and the OKX Wallet.\nNo, the MetaMask wallet does not support the Bitcoin network and ordinals. Hence, BRC-20 tokens can not be stored on MetaMask.\nBRC-20 tokens can be purchased on centralized or decentralized exchanges (DEX) where they are listed or on ordinals exchanges. While buying BRC-20 tokens on centralized exchanges (CEX) takes the normal procedure, to purchase BRC-20 tokens on an ordinals exchange, you need an ordinals wallet.\nBRC-20 tokens have become popular in the meme economy. The top three meme coins, ORDI, Pepe, and Meme, account for approximately 50% of the market share.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "8 Best Blockchains for NFT Development (2023)",
    "content": "The crypto industry has witnessed a proliferation of blockchains, each vying for attention and user adoption. While Ethereum has long reigned supreme as the go-to blockchain for NFT enthusiasts, alternative platforms have gained traction due to concerns over high transaction fees and environmental sustainability.\nCreating a definitive list of the top NFT blockchains presents challenges due to the ever-evolving nature of the crypto industry. Rankings frequently shift as new developments emerge. Nonetheless, certain chains, notably Ethereum and Solana, have firmly cemented their positions on the NFT blockchain leaderboard, while other chains face more intense competition.\nTo determine the most suitable blockchains for NFT development, factors such as network size, creator costs, consumer spending patterns, security, and community input need careful consideration. Let\u0027s explore the optimal choices for NFT development.\nWhat Are the Top Blockchains for NFT Development?\nLet’s explore the list of popular blockchains for developing NFTs in the section below.\n1. Ethereum – The Pioneer of the NFT Landscape\nEthereum remains the dominant NFT chain in the space, offering a decentralized ecosystem encompassing various financial and legal services. Renowned NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, popular projects like CryptoPunks, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), as well as acclaimed artists such as Pak and Beeple have made Ethereum their home.\nUntil late 2022, the majority of NFT trading took place on OpenSea. OpenSea facilitated the exchange of billions of dollars worth of NFTs during the bullish market period. However, a significant shift in trading volume for Ethereum-based NFTs occurred with the launch of Blur, a professional-oriented NFT marketplace, in October 2022. In February 2023, Blur\u0027s trading volume surpassed that of OpenSea for the first time.\nThe popularity of NFTs on the Ethereum network comes with a drawback. During periods of intense NFT trading activity, the network becomes congested, causing transaction fees, known as gas fees, to skyrocket. For example, in 2022, when Yuga Labs introduced its Otherdeeds NFTs on Ethereum, investors faced gas fees totaling over $100 million, with individual transactions incurring fees as high as $3,000. This highlights the challenges faced by Ethereum due to the high demand for NFTs, leading to congestion issues and exorbitant gas fees.\n2. Solana – Unleashing Speed and Scalability\nSince its establishment in 2017, Solana has emerged as the second-largest NFT blockchain, boasting a thriving NFT ecosystem. Solana addresses the scalability and transaction speed limitations blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin face. The platform\u0027s largest NFT marketplace, Magic Eden, has already witnessed trading volumes exceeding $1 billion. In May 2022, Magic Eden surpassed OpenSea\u0027s NFT trading volume on Ethereum. Additionally, as of April 2022, OpenSea began supporting Solana NFTs, further expanding their reach.\nTo buy and sell Solana NFTs, users need a Solana-compatible wallet, such as Trust Wallet, Exodus Wallet, or Phantom. These wallets need to be funded with sufficient SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the Solana network, to cover any gas fees. It\u0027s worth noting that Solana\u0027s gas fees are generally lower compared to Ethereum, typically amounting to just a fraction of a penny. This affordability enhances the accessibility and attractiveness of participating in the Solana NFT marketplace.\n3. Tezos – Self-Amendment and Innovation\nFounded in 2017, Tezos distinguishes itself through its self-amendment capabilities, enabling the blockchain to evolve over time through a formalized protocol upgrade process. This focus on innovation, coupled with its support for smart contracts and decentralized applications, has positioned Tezos as a leader in operability.\nSimilar to Solana and Ethereum, Tezos employs a PoS consensus mechanism, reducing computational work and transaction fees. While it may not boast the same market dominance as Ethereum, Tezos provides an excellent platform for minting batches of NFTs or building large-scale collections. Objkt is currently the largest and most popular marketplace on the Tezos chain.\n4. Flow – Tailored for NFTs, Games, and DApps\nFlow is a high-performance blockchain specifically designed for NFTs, games, and decentralized applications. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, such as Ethereum, Flow prioritizes scalability, envisioning a future where billions of people can interact seamlessly with NFTs on the blockchain.\nFlow gained significant attention through its partnership with the NBA, hosting NBA Top Shot and playing a vital role in popularizing NFTs. Flow utilizes a PoS consensus mechanism and boasts high transaction throughput, although exact numbers are not specified by the developers. While Flow is not as widely adopted as Ethereum, it has attracted notable sporting organizations like the NBA, NFL, and UFC to launch their own NFT marketplaces on the blockchain.\n5. Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) – The Hub for Digital Collectibles\nWorldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) is a blockchain platform designed specifically for digital collectibles, virtual goods, and gaming items. It aims to provide a user-friendly and accessible ecosystem for creators and collectors alike. WAX utilizes a delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which ensures fast block confirmation times and high scalability.\nWAX has gained recognition for its partnerships with major brands and franchises, including Topps, Capcom, and William Shatner. The platform hosts a variety of NFT marketplaces, such as the WAX Marketplace and AtomicHub, where users can buy, sell, and trade digital assets.\n6. Binance Chain (BNB) – The Growing Ethereum Competitor\nFormerly two separate chains – Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Binance Chain, Binance rebranded to BNB Chain in February 2022 to foster innovation in the network and move toward greater decentralization.\nBinance Chain (BNB) is a blockchain platform developed by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. While BNB is primarily known for its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, it has also gained traction as an alternative blockchain for NFTs. BSC offers lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, attracting users looking for more cost-effective options.\nBNB employs a Proof-of-Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, which combines elements of PoS and Proof-of-Authority (PoA) to achieve consensus efficiently. The platform supports various NFT marketplaces, including AirNFTs, BakerySwap and NFTb, where users can engage in NFT trading and collectibles.\n7. Polygon – Enhancing Ethereum\u0027s Scalability\nPolygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. It addresses Ethereum\u0027s scalability issues by providing a framework for building and connecting multiple sidechains, which operate in parallel with the Ethereum mainnet. This enables faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum.Polygon has become a popular choice for NFT projects seeking to mitigate high gas fees and enhance user experience. Many Ethereum-based NFT platforms, such as OpenSea and Aavegotchi, have integrated with Polygon to leverage its scalability features.\n8. Bitcoin – NFTs on the Original Cryptocurrency\nBitcoin, the pioneering blockchain known for its focus on cryptocurrency transactions, has entered the NFT space. This development came about with the launch of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol by software engineer Casey Rodarmor on January 21, 2023. The introduction of this upgrade has caused significant controversy among Bitcoin enthusiasts, also known as Bitcoin \"maxis,\" and within the broader NFT ecosystem.\nThe Bitcoin Ordinals protocol allows Bitcoin node operators to inscribe visual and data-based information onto the tiny units of Bitcoin called satoshis (sats). As a result, fully on-chain NFTs, called Inscriptions, are created. These Inscriptions are assigned chronological numbers, with lower numbers holding higher historical significance. The concept of Ordinals quickly gained traction, and NFT enthusiasts started valuing and trading them accordingly.\nAcquiring Bitcoin NFTs has been cumbersome because Bitcoin\u0027s infrastructure is not designed for NFT transactions. However, Web3 builders have been developing Bitcoin Ordinals wallets to streamline the process for interested buyers. Over time, the accessibility and ease of obtaining Bitcoin NFTs are expected to improve.\nIntroducing Bitcoin NFTs has sparked considerable excitement and activity within the Web3 ecosystem. Ordinal Inscriptions recently surpassed one million, indicating the growing interest in this space. Even Yuga Labs, the creators of the renowned Bored Ape Yacht Club, joined in by minting a 300-piece collection on the blockchain on March 5, 2023.\nIf you are new to NFTs, it\u0027s important to note that Bitcoin might not be the ideal starting point for learning about this technology, at least for now. However, if you are interested in being at the forefront of NFT development and innovation, exploring Bitcoin NFTs could be an exciting venture.\nHow to Choose the Right Blockchain for NFT Development?\nSelecting the suitable NFT blockchain depends on various factors, including your specific needs as a creator or collector. Ethereum remains the dominant player, offering a vast ecosystem and established NFT marketplaces. However, alternative blockchains like Solana, Tezos, Flow, WAX, BNB, and Polygon provide unique advantages such as scalability, lower fees, tailored NFT functionalities, and partnerships with prominent brands.\nIn your quest to explore the exciting world of NFTs, let me introduce you to AirNFTs—the ultimate multi-chain marketplace that opens up a realm of possibilities. Seamlessly connecting the Binance Chain (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and Fantom (FTM) blockchains, AirNFTs offers you a gateway to an expansive and diverse NFT ecosystem.\nWhat sets AirNFTs apart is its commitment to providing a user-friendly experience without compromising efficiency or cost-effectiveness.

Join AirNFTs today and experience a world of creativity, community, and endless opportunities.\nFollow us on\nEthereum remains the most popular NFT blockchain and ecosystem despite mounting competition from other blockchain networks in recent years. It is the leading blockchain for NFTs in terms of users and trading volume.\nThe criteria to consider before choosing the right blockchain include: Transaction Speed, Transaction cost, Security, Smart contract functionality, Consensus mechanism, Scalability, Adoption rate, and Functionality.\nThe most widely used blockchain for NFT initiatives is Ethereum, which is now at the cutting edge of blockchain technology. The two well-liked native tokens of Ethereum, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, respectively, are used to construct non-fungible and semi-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nThe Ethereum network. Ethereum is the blockchain that supports NFTs the most, and to date, the most NFT trade volumes reside on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum’s market capitalization is over $225.88B.\nNFT blockchains are essential for preserving the unique, verifiable, and unalterable nature of NFTs. They enable the validation of ownership in various domains like art, intellectual property, real estate, and collectibles. NFT marketplaces are publicly accessible platforms where users can create, buy, and sell NFTs.

    "content": "NFTs, the game-changers of the digital realm, have taken the world by storm, reshaping how we value and monetize digital assets. NFTs have gained significant popularity due to their ability to authenticate, verify, and transfer ownership of digital assets seamlessly. Beyond art and collectibles, NFTs also hold the key to exciting opportunities for passive income.\nBrace yourself as we dive into some of the ultimate secrets of earning with NFTs, unveiling the top five ways to make passive income with NFTs and the best strategies you can implement today.\nWhat are NFTs?\nIn simple terms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership of specific content or media, ranging from artwork and music to videos or memes. What sets NFTs apart is their indivisible and non-replicable nature. Their unique characteristics have captivated the attention of countless individuals, driving them to explore opportunities for passive income through NFT ownership.\nUnlike fungible tokens, NFTs possess distinct values and cannot be interchanged with one another. This has empowered artists and creators to tokenize their creations as NFTs while retaining complete ownership and control.\nWhat are the advantages of NFTs?\nWhile some may dismiss NFTs as a passing digital trend, they have emerged as a significant advancement with numerous benefits over traditional physical and virtual assets. Here are some advantages they offer:\nNow that you understand the inherent advantages of NFTs, let\u0027s explore the best strategies to leverage when it comes to earning passive income with NFTs.\nThe 5 Best Ways to Make Passive Income from NFTs\nAs previously mentioned, NFTs offer a unique feature that allows creators to receive royalty fees each time their NFTs are resold on the secondary market. This means that creators can passively earn income by collecting royalties without active involvement in the sales process.\nRoyalties are automatically paid, making it a convenient and hassle-free option. Many NFT marketplaces facilitate this feature, making monetizing creators\u0027 work easy. To earn NFT royalties, you need to mint your work and set the desired royalty fees for each subsequent sale.\nNFT staking has emerged as a popular method for generating passive income within the cryptocurrency realm. The concept is similar to having funds in a traditional savings account and earning interest while they sit idle.\nWith NFT staking, users stake their non-fungible tokens in specific smart contracts that reward them with additional tokens or the original staked tokens for holding their NFTs over a predetermined staking period. Some NFT projects also allow staking in liquidity pools, enabling users to earn a portion of transaction fees generated by the platform. Liquidity pools consist of digital assets locked in smart contracts, pooled together by multiple investors, and utilized by crypto platforms for lending purposes. This passive income strategy leverages the platform\u0027s activity to generate earnings for NFT holders.\nNFT renting enables owners to lend their digital assets to other users for a specific period in exchange for rental fees, offering a passive income stream. Analogous to renting physical properties, NFT rentals have gained traction, particularly in the metaverse and gaming industry, where virtual spaces and real estate NFTs are in high demand. Numerous NFT renting platforms, including Vera, UnitBox DAO, and reNFT, facilitate renting NFTs. The rental process typically involves the following:\nNFT owners can choose to periodically rent out their assets or invest in NFTs to rent them out for profit. Evaluating the potential demand and rental value of NFTs is crucial when pursuing this income-generating avenue.\nNFT farming presents an alternative approach to earning passive income from NFTs, requiring more active participation than staking but offering potentially higher returns. This strategy involves providing liquidity to NFT pools within decentraized finance (DeFi) platforms. Users deposit their NFTs into liquidity pools and, in return, receive rewards such as new NFTs or the original staked tokens.\nNFT farming operates similarly to yield farming in DeFi, with the distinction being the staking of NFTs to earn rewards. This approach allows users to sell the farming rewards for profit or reinvest them in other NFT or DeFi platforms. By providing liquidity to the market, NFT farming can increase the value of NFTs and support the growth of decentralized applications (dApps).\nWhile not as prevalent as other strategies, some platforms offer NFT index funds, allowing investors to invest passively in diversified portfolios of NFTs. This approach provides exposure to the NFT market without the need for active management of individual NFTs.\nNFT index funds function similarly to traditional index funds, tracking the performance of specific NFT indexes or market segments, such as collections of rare artwork or specific types of collectibles. To invest in an NFT index fund, individuals typically purchase shares through specialized brokers or investment platforms focusing on NFTs. These shares represent fractional ownership of the underlying NFTs held within the fund, and their value fluctuates based on NFT performance.\nAs with any investment, thorough research on the index fund and its NFTs and understanding the associated risks are essential. Additionally, attention should be given to investment fees to optimize potential returns.\nRisks and challenges of making passive income with NFTs\nAs with any investment, risks, and challenges are associated with making passive income with NFTs. It\u0027s essential to be aware of these factors before diving into the NFT market:\nThe Takeaway\nGenerating passive income with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offers various strategies, and today we explored some simple and intuitive approaches to get you started. As the NFT market evolves, new opportunities will arise, allowing crypto users and newcomers to tap into the expanding digital asset economy. By staying updated on NFT developments, you can identify innovative income-generating avenues and capitalize on future rewards.\nReady to start making passive income through NFTs and DeFi? Look no further than AirNFTs! Check out this guide to learn how to begin earning today.\nFollow us on\nCreators of NFTs can earn passive income through royalty fees. When an NFT is resold on the secondary market, the original creator receives a percentage of the sale. This allows creators to earn money without actively participating in each transaction.\nNFT Collection Coins, NFT Game Coins, and NFT Platform Coins.\nThere are several ways to earn with NFTs, including renting out your NFTs for a fee to others who want to showcase them temporarily, Staking your NFTs for rewards, Lending your NFTs to others in exchange for interest payments, or you can earn royalties as a percentage of each subsequent sale of your NFTs.\nArt stands as the most popular and sought-after form of NFT. Consequently, it is also the category of NFTs that experiences the highest demand and sales.\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "content": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the world of digital assets, providing a new and exciting way for artists and creators to monetize their work. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of creating an NFT that stands out from the crowd and sells successfully. Whether you\u0027re an artist looking to showcase your talent or someone curious about this emerging technology, this guide is your key to success. Let\u0027s dive in!\nWhat is an NFT and How to create one?\nBefore we delve into the creation process, let\u0027s quickly grasp the concept of NFTs. Non-Fungible Tokens are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, giving them inherent value and authenticity. NFTs can represent anything from artwork, music, videos, tweets, and even memes. Creating an NFT can be a lucrative endeavor for artists and creators but can also be intimidating for those new to the technology.\n5 Tips for Creating an NFT that Sells\nNow, let\u0027s explore the crucial steps to create an NFT that captures attention and sells like hotcakes.\nWhen it comes to creating an NFT, quality is paramount. Just like physical art, your digital asset should be of exceptional quality and possess a unique appeal. Dedicate time and effort to create something special that will captivate potential buyers. Remember, the better the quality, the higher the perceived value of your NFT.\nTo make your NFT stand out in a sea of options, infuse it with a compelling backstory or message. Authenticity and storytelling are crucial elements that resonate with buyers. Craft a narrative that connects with the emotions and experiences of your target audience. A well-crafted story can elevate the value of your NFT and create a stronger bond with buyers.\nNFT marketplaces thrive on community engagement, so it\u0027s vital to participate and connect with fellow artists and collectors actively. Join forums, attend events, and network with creators to build a following and gain visibility within the NFT ecosystem. Engaging with the community helps you learn from others, opens up collaboration opportunities, and expands your reach.\nFractional ownership is a game-changer in the world of NFTs. Allowing multiple buyers to own a percentage of an NFT makes it more accessible to a broader audience. Consider offering fractional ownership options to attract a larger pool of buyers. This inclusivity can create a sense of community and shared ownership, driving demand for your NFT.\nTransparency is vital when creating an NFT. Ensure you communicate ownership rights, royalties, and other pertinent details about your NFT. Avoid any potential confusion or disputes by providing comprehensive information upfront. Buyers value transparency, fostering trust and credibility in the NFT market.\nThe NFT Creation Process: Step-by-Step Guide\nNow that we\u0027ve covered the essential tips for creating a successful NFT, let\u0027s dive into the step-by-step process of bringing your NFT to life.\nNFTs are commonly associated with digital art, such as an image, audio production (like a song), or even a short video clip (like an animated GIF). The idea is to produce a distinctive piece of digital media that can be sold, similar to the sale of a painting at an art gallery. NFTs offer value to creators by being one-of-a-kind, something that cannot be owned by anyone else. Verifying that you have the rightful ownership of the digital media you are using is crucial, as generating an NFT from media you don\u0027t own could result in legal consequences.\nSelecting the right NFT platform is crucial for a smooth and successful NFT creation journey. Here are a few popular platforms to consider:\nTake the time to research and compare different NFT platforms based on their features, fees, and community support to find the best fit for your needs.\nTo participate in the NFT marketplaces, you\u0027ll need a digital wallet to store your cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Here\u0027s how to set up your wallet:\nOnce you\u0027ve set up your wallet, transfer some cryptocurrency to cover gas fees and other expenses associated with creating and selling NFTs.\nWith your wallet set up, it\u0027s time to create your NFT. Here\u0027s a sample process using AirNFTs. Ensure you have sufficient cryptocurrency in your wallet (ETH, BSC, FTM, or MATIC), open the in-app browser and follow these steps:\n1. Visit www.airnfts.com and click on “Trade NFTs Now.”\n2. Select the on “Create” option.\n3. \"Choose the file\" you want to upload a\n4. Select the appropriate \"Blockchain.\"\n5.

Click \"Approve,\" pay the storage fee (consider optimizing your image size using tinypng.com), and select \"Create\" to mint your NFT.\nAfter completing these steps, your file will upload, and your NFT will be created and listed for sale on the blockchain of your choice.\nUnderstanding Costs and Fees\nWhen selling an NFT, knowing the costs and fees is essential. Here are some key points to consider:\nNow that you\u0027re equipped with the knowledge of costs and fees, you can make informed decisions when creating and selling your NFTs.\nCan I Create an NFT for free?\nYes, creating an NFT for free on certain platforms is possible. Many NFT marketplaces offer a concept called \"lazy minting,\" which allows creators to mint NFTs without upfront costs. The fees are deferred until the NFT is sold on the marketplace. However, it\u0027s important to note that transaction fees, such as gas fees, may still apply when selling or transferring the NFT on the blockchain.\nExploring different platforms and their minting options is recommended to find the best fit for your budget and requirements.\nHow do I convert an image to NFT?\nConverting an image into an NFT is a straightforward process. Here\u0027s a summary of the steps involved:\nClosing Thoughts\nCreating and selling NFTs can be an exciting and potentially lucrative venture. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you\u0027re well on your way to creating an NFT that stands out in the market. Remember to prioritize quality, engage with the NFT community, and choose the right platform for your needs. With careful planning and strategic decision-making, you can start earning with your own NFTs today.\n‍Happy creating!\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "Meme Coins: What are they and How do they Work?",
    "content": "Cryptocurrency has been around for over a decade and has become a popular alternative to traditional fiat currency. A new trend in the crypto space called \"meme coins\" has emerged recently. These coins, also known as \"joke coins,\" are digital currencies created for fun and entertainment purposes. Meme coins have unique characteristics that differentiate them from other cryptocurrencies. These meme-based coins have unique features that distinguish them from other cryptocurrencies.\nThis article provides a beginner\u0027s guide to understanding meme coins, their functionality, and the reasons behind their growing popularity.\nWhat is a Meme Coin?\nA meme coin is a cryptocurrency inspired by a meme, which can be an image, video, or other media. Unlike traditional crypto coins, meme coins do not typically have real-world applications or use cases beyond being shared among users. Aside from that, meme coins function similarly to standard cryptocurrencies and can be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nMeme coins gained popularity as a fun alternative to mainstream cryptocurrencies. Some coins, like Dogecoin, were explicitly created to poke fun at cryptocurrency hype. As meme coins continue gaining traction, their creators have started envisioning more specific projects and purposes. This has led to the emergence of meme tokens tailored for video games, charities, and online marketplaces.\nWhat is the difference between Meme Coin and Crypto Coin?\nWhile both meme coins and crypto coins use blockchain technology, they differ significantly in their goals, structures, and values. Crypto coins, or cryptocurrencies, are digital currencies that use cryptography to secure transactions and regulate the creation of new units. They are designed to be used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are widely recognized and have gained widespread acceptance and adoption. They can be used for online purchases of goods and services or traded for other currencies or assets.\nOn the other hand, Meme coins are a subset of cryptocurrencies primarily intended for entertainment or social commentary. They derive value from their popularity and the demand from enthusiasts, often featuring images or symbols related to popular culture or internet memes. Shiba Inu, Hoge Finance, and Dogecoin are examples of meme coins.\nWhy are Meme Coins Popular?\nThe rise of meme coins can be traced back to the popularity of Dogecoin, which was created in 2013 by two software engineers as a joke. Dogecoin gained popularity after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted about it in 2019, and its value skyrocketed. This sparked the creation of other meme coins, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and SafeMoon (SAFEMOON).\nMeme coins have become very popular that they are now among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Furthermore, due to the relatively low value per token, meme coins often attract traders who seek to expand their investment portfolios. However, due to the high volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future of these coins in the cryptocurrency market, they are regarded as high-risk investment options.\nHow do Meme Coins Work?\nMeme coins work in a similar way to other cryptocurrencies. They are based on blockchain technology and are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any government or financial institution. Transactions are verified through a network of computers, and the transaction history is recorded on a public ledger, making it transparent and immutable. This allows meme coins to be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) without the need for intermediaries.\nWhat are the Popular Meme Coins?\nThere are several popular meme coins, including:\nThese coins have gained a significant following on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, where users discuss their potential for high returns.\nIs it safe to invest in Meme Coins?\nInvesting in meme coins can be risky due to their association with hype and social media and their high volatility. However, for those willing to take risks, there is a potential for high returns. In 2023, meme coins like Pepe Coin, Baby Doge, Floki Inu, Dogelon Mars, and Cope have seen significant gains due to strong community support.\nNevertheless, conducting extensive research and fully comprehending the potential risks and rewards before making investment decisions is essential. It\u0027s also advisable to only invest what you can afford to lose and diversify your portfolio to minimize risk.\nHow to Buy Meme Coins?\nMeme coins can be bought and sold on a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as PancakeSwap, and centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, FTX, and Kraken. Investors should do their own research and choose a reputable exchange to buy and sell meme coins.\nInvestors should also be aware of the fees associated with buying and selling meme coins. Some exchanges charge high fees, which can eat into profits.\nHow to find new Meme Coins early?\nIf you want to discover meme coins before they gain popularity, conducting extensive research on the coin\u0027s technology, development team, liquidity pool, and community of supporters is crucial. Besides, social media hype and online communities can be excellent sources of information on emerging meme coins. By staying on top of these trends, investors can identify promising meme coins and potentially reap significant rewards.\nConclusion\nAs with any trend, there’s always the risk of a bubble bursting. However, meme coins are an intriguing and fascinating aspect of the cryptocurrency market, but investors should approach them with caution and careful consideration. Some experts believe that meme coins will eventually fade away, while others see them as the future of cryptocurrency. The future will tell better.\nStay up-to-date on the latest crypto and NFT trends by following us on social media and keeping an eye on our blog.\nFollow us on\nWhile investing in meme coins may seem appealing due to their potential for high rewards, it is essential to note that they also come with a high level of risk due to their association with hype and social media and their high volatility. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to thoroughly research and understand the potential risks and rewards before making any investment decisions.\nSome popular meme coins include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Safemoon. In 2023, other meme coins like Pepe Coin, Baby Doge, Floki Inu, Dogelon Mars, and Cope have seen significant gains due to strong community support.\nMeme coins are currently unregulated, but there have been calls for greater regulation of the cryptocurrency market, including meme coins.\nMeme coins can be bought and sold on a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs).\nThe future of meme coins is uncertain, but some experts believe they will continue to evolve and find new use cases that will make them more valuable.

    "title": "What are NFTs and How do they work?",
    "content": "If you\u0027ve been following the cryptocurrency world, you may have heard the term \"non-fungible token\" or NFT. In recent years, NFTs have become popular in the digital art world and beyond. But what exactly is an NFT, and how does it work? In this article, we\u0027ll take a deep dive into the world of NFTs, including what they are, how they work, and why they have become so popular.\nWhat does NFT mean?\nNFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are a type of digital asset that is unique and non-interchangeable. Unlike regular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible, NFTs cannot be exchanged for each other on a one-to-one basis. Each NFT is unique and represents a specific asset, such as a piece of art or a digital collectible.\nNFTs are stored on a blockchain, just like other cryptocurrencies. The most popular blockchain for NFTs is Ethereum, but other blockchains like Binance Chain (formally Binance Smart Chain), Solana, and Flow are also starting to gain popularity.\nHow do NFTs work?\nNFTs are created using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These smart contracts are stored on the blockchain and are publicly visible.\nWhen someone creates an NFT, they include specific details about the asset it represents, such as its name, description, and image. The NFT is then minted on the blockchain, creating a unique digital certificate of ownership for that specific asset. This certificate of ownership is stored on the blockchain and can be transferred between owners just like regular cryptocurrency.\nAdvantages of NFTs\nNFTs offer numerous benefits that make them valuable in various fields, from art to real estate. Here are some of the most significant advantages of using NFTs:\nOne of the most apparent benefits of NFTs is their ability to streamline sales processes and eliminate intermediaries. By tokenizing a physical asset, NFTs facilitate direct transactions between buyers and sellers, removing the need for agents. For example, NFTs representing digital or physical artwork on a blockchain can allow artists to connect directly with their target audiences and sell their works without the assistance of agents.\nNFTs can also be used to simplify investing in various assets. For instance, Real estate is an asset that can be tokenized using NFTs. A property can be divided into multiple sections, each with different characteristics. For example, a lakeside unit could be priced differently from one closer to the forest. By assigning an NFT to each portion of the property, real estate trading can be simplified by incorporating relevant metadata into the unique NFTs.\nNFTs can represent ownership in a business, similar to stocks. Stock ownership is already tracked via ledgers that contain information such as the stockholder\u0027s name, date of issuance, certificate number, and the number of shares. Using NFTs and blockchain instead of a stock ledger can automate ownership transfer, making it easier to transfer business shares.\nNFTs can also enhance security, particularly when it comes to identity protection. Personal information stored on an immutable blockchain cannot be accessed, stolen, or used by anyone without the proper keys. Therefore, NFTs can serve as a secure means of storing sensitive information.‍\nNFTs can democratize investing by fractionalizing physical assets like real estate and artwork. Dividing a digital real estate asset among multiple owners is much easier than doing the same with a physical one. By purchasing a share of a painting or other expensive art, multiple individuals can collectively own a fraction of the physical artwork, increasing its worth and revenues.\nChallenges of NFTs\nNFTs face several challenges, including environmental impact, legal and regulatory issues, and technical limitations. The energy consumption required to create and manage NFTs is a significant concern. There are also legal and regulatory issues surrounding the ownership and trade of NFTs and technical limitations such as scalability and interoperability.\nAnother challenge of NFTs is their potential for speculative bubbles. Because NFTs are a new and rapidly evolving market, prices can be highly volatile. Some NFTs have sold for millions of dollars, leading some to speculate that the market is in a bubble that will eventually burst.\nWhat are NFTs being used for?\nOne of the most famous use cases for NFTs is Cryptokitties, digital cats with unique identities on the Ethereum blockchain. Each cat has a different value and can \"breed\" with others to create new offspring. Fans spent $20 million worth of ether on Cryptokitties within weeks of its launch, with some enthusiasts spending over $100,000. The Bored Ape Yacht Club is another NFT project that has gained attention for its high prices, celebrity following, and theft of some of its 10,000 NFTs.\nNFTs can be used for anything that requires proof of ownership or authenticity, such as trading cards, real estate titles, photography, patents, music, sports, etc. NFTs can also be used for in-game items and virtual real estate. This allows gamers to own unique and rare in-game items that can be bought, sold, and traded on NFT marketplaces, just like physical collectibles. It also provides a new revenue stream for game developers.\nIn addition, NFTs can be used for charity fundraising. Some charities have created NFTs that represent specific donations or fundraising campaigns. By buying an NFT, donors can show their support for the cause while also receiving a unique digital asset.\nThe future of NFTs\nDespite the challenges facing NFTs, they have enormous growth potential. The increasing popularity of NFTs is expected to continue, with more industries adopting them. NFTs could also be integrated with other technologies, such as augmented reality and virtual reality. The evolution of NFT standards is also expected to facilitate the growth and adoption of NFTs.\nHow to buy and sell NFTs?\nNFTs are purchased using cryptocurrency such as Ether (ETH). Therefore, owning cryptocurrency– and storing it in a digital wallet is the first step. You can buy NFTs via any online NFT marketplaces, including AirNFTs, OpenSea, Rarible, or SuperRare.\nBest NFT Marketplaces in the Game\nThere are many NFT marketplaces where you can buy and sell NFTs.

    "title": "Understanding Dynamic NFTs: Use Cases and Examples",
    "content": "As NFT technology continues to develop and gain more adoption, new types and use cases for NFTs are emerging. One of the most exciting recent developments is the rise of dynamic NFTs, or dNFTs, which bring a new level of interactivity and functionality to digital assets. While static NFTs have been around for a while, dynamic NFTs are now in the spotlight and sparking exciting discussions within the NFT community.\nLet\u0027s explore the concept of dynamic NFTs, how they work, their use cases, and why they may represent the future of non-fungible tokens.\nWhat are dynamic NFTs (dNFTs)?\nDynamic NFTs, also known as dNFTs, are a new type of non-fungible token that incorporates programmable and interactive features, enabling the creation of digital assets that can change and evolve over time. dNFTs allow for updates and changes to be made to the underlying data without changing the unique ID of the NFT. This is possible through a smart contract that can automatically update the metadata associated with the NFT in response to specific conditions or user interactions.\nA dynamic NFT can respond to external parameters or conditions such as user behavior, real-time market prices, time, weather, or other environmental data. For example, Pearpop\u0027s dynamic NFTs allow creators to mint NFTs of their social media posts on the Solana blockchain. The NFT\u0027s rank increases when the post gains popularity, using metadata such as comments, shares, and likes.\nTo understand dynamic NFTs, let\u0027s take a simple example. Imagine an NFT that represents a car. A static NFT would only represent the car as it is, without any additional functionality. However, a dynamic NFT could be programmed to reflect the car\u0027s current mileage, maintenance history, and even the current market value. This added functionality makes the NFT more valuable as it provides additional data and insights unavailable in a static NFT.\nWhat are the Limitations of static NFTs?\nStatic NFTs have revolutionized the world of digital art, providing a way for artists to establish ownership and prevent illegal copying of their original works. However, static NFTs have limitations that can hinder their usefulness in certain scenarios. Here are some of the limitations of static NFTs in digital art and beyond:\nBoth static NFTs and dynamic NFTs have unique properties and can be used in various applications, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the use case. However, Dynamic NFTs offer a solution to the limitations of traditional static NFTs, making them useful for various applications, such as:\nHow do dynamic NFTs work?\nDynamic NFTs operate on the same progressive blockchain technology that underpins traditional static NFTs. However, dynamic NFTs have rules determining how they can evolve or change over time. These rules are encoded within smart contracts, which automate functions like changing the appearance, animations, or behavior of the NFT based on specific circumstances.\nMoreover, dynamic NFTs differ from traditional NFTs in that they use the ERC-1155 token standard. While static NFTs are typically created using the ERC-721 token standard, dynamic NFTs use the ERC-1155 standard, which allows for storing data in a format that can be edited if needed, making them \"semi-fungible.\"\nUsing oracles, dynamic NFTs can become more than static representations of digital assets. They can become interactive and responsive, allowing new use cases and applications. When an oracle sends external data to the smart contract, it triggers a change in a dynamic NFT, and the metadata of the NFT is updated. As a result, the appearance and other characteristics of the NFT will also be updated. Smart contracts also dictate how dynamic NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded and how royalties are distributed to their creators.\nTo interact with dynamic NFTs, users need a crypto wallet that supports smart contracts. Users can collect, sell, or trade NFTs on NFT marketplaces or use them in decentralized applications (DApps) that support dynamic NFT features.\nWhat are the benefits of dynamic NFTs?\nDynamic NFTs offer several benefits, including:\nUse cases for dynamic NFTs\nDynamic NFTs have numerous potential use cases. Here are some of the most exciting ones:\nGaming is one of the most significant use cases for NFTs, and dynamic NFTs could be used to represent in-game items that change based on the player\u0027s progress or achievements. For example, a sword in a game could start off as a basic weapon but become more powerful as the player levels up.\nA dynamic NFT could represent property and be programmed to update its value based on changes in the real estate market. This would allow for more accurate and up-to-date valuations of properties, making it easier for buyers and sellers to negotiate deals.\nCollectibles are already a popular use case for NFTs, but dynamic NFTs could take it even further. A dynamic NFT could represent a rare item that changes based on the time of day or the weather conditions, making it even more unique and valuable. This would create new opportunities for collectors and investors to own rare and dynamic assets.\nA dynamic NFT could represent a piece of digital art that changes based on the time of day or the viewer\u0027s location. This would create a new level of interactivity and engagement, making digital art even more valuable and exciting.\nExamples of dynamic NFTs\n1. LaMelo Ball, a professional basketball player, has released eight dynamic NFTs that track his different stats, like rebounds and assists. These NFTs change based on his game statistics, and holders can receive unique benefits depending on his performance. For example, if he gets 10 assists in a game, the NFT could change to a different background color. One of the NFTs, the Gold Change NFT, was conditional upon LaMelo winning Rookie of the Year; when he did, the NFT changed to a different image entirely.\n2. Regenerative Resources (RRC) is another example of a dynamic NFT. RRC, an ecosystem services company, released five Short Film NFTs created by famous artists in December 2021. The money generated from the sales will be used to plant 100 million mangroves. The first frame of each Short Film NFT is displayed at first and, when bought or sold, the short film is shown frame by frame until the NFT holder can see the entire film.\nConclusion\nDynamic NFTs are the future of non-fungible tokens. While static NFTs have limitations, dynamic NFTs provide endless possibilities for use cases, making them an exciting development within the NFT community.\nInterested in joining the NFT revolution?

    "content": "As the demand for NFTs continues to grow, so does the popularity of Arbitrum, the most sought-after Ethereum Layer 2 network with over $1 billion in assets locked on DeFi and NFT applications. With several marketplaces available for buying and selling NFTs on Arbitrum, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. In this article, we\u0027ll look closely at some of the best NFT marketplaces on Arbitrum and why they stand out.\nWhat is Arbitrum?\nArbitrum is a new layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain developed by a new york based company known as Off-chain labs. Layer-2 scaling solutions are networks that sit on top of layer 1 blockchains to provide cheap and fast transactions. They reduce the congestion on the main blockchain by validating transactions separately and integrating them into the main chain.\nAfter its mainnet launch last year, Arbitrum\u0027s scaling solution has seen a lot of success. As a result of this, several developers have used Arbitrum\u0027s solutions to host their dApps.\nHow does Arbitrum Work?\nThe Arbitrum blockchain uses rollups to combine multiple transactions into one, lowering on-chain transaction costs and boosting scalability. Arbitrum is reliable, affordable, and super fast. While the Ethereum blockchain clocks 14 transactions per second, Arbitrum zooms ahead with close to 40,000 transactions per second. While transactions on Ethereum might cost several dollars, transactions on Arbitrum cost a few cents.\nArbitrum also supports integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it easy for developers.\nArbitrum processes Ethereum transactions through what is known as “optimistic” rollups. These transactions are settled on a side chain before being fed to the main Ethereum blockchain through the Arbitrum bridge.\nThe Top 5 NFT Marketplaces on Arbitrum\nHere are some of the best arbitrum NFT marketplaces for buying and selling NFTs:\nTofuNFT is the go-to NFT marketplace on Arbitrum, offering the largest selection of Arbitrum-native NFTs and digital collectibles, including popular sets like GMX Blueberries.

    "content": "The non-fungible token (NFT) market is thriving in 2023. This quarter alone, the global NFT market has seen over $2B in trading volumes and a surge in active users.\nAre you looking to buy or sell NFTs but need help figuring out how to start? Our step-by-step guide will help you navigate the process on an NFT marketplace.\nWhat is an Non-Fungible token (NFT)?\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets that have been tokenized via a blockchain. They are assigned unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from other tokens. NFTs can be traded and exchanged for money, cryptocurrencies, or other NFTs—it all depends on the value the market and owners have placed on them.\nCryptocurrencies are tokens as well; however, the key difference is that two cryptocurrencies from the same blockchain are interchangeable—they are fungible. Two NFTs from the same blockchain can look identical, but they are not interchangeable.\nWhat is an NFT Marketplace?\nAn NFT marketplace is a digital platform where anyone can buy and sell NFTs. NFT marketplaces can be decentralized or centralized.\nDecentralized NFT marketplaces are the most common, allowing users to connect with web3 wallets, trade, and disconnect at will. Decentralized marketplaces give users complete control of their accounts and NFTs.\nOn the other hand, centralized NFT marketplaces hold customers\u0027 accounts and typically require them to perform a KYC verification before enabling them to trade.\nA Look at a Typical NFT Marketplace\nWhile NFT marketplaces may differ in their user interface and experience, the following features cut across platforms:\n1. Explore: the explore page usually forms the homepage or dashboard of any marketplace and features every available NFT. The assets are typically grouped by type– art, gaming, photography, influencer NFTs and can be filtered through metrics such as price, date added, upvotes, etc.\n2. Collections: here, you can find art collections and explore several kinds of NFTs a single user provides. For example, the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection created by Yuga labs comprises 10,000 unique ape-themed NFTs. Also, the launchpad campaign created on AirNFTs features 9000 unique NFTs with over 4000 owners.\n3. Hot Auctions: NFT auctions work similarly to traditional auctions. On the auctions page, sellers list their NFTs for a specific timeframe for buyers to place bids.\n4. User Profile or Wallet page: Your profile page displays your NFT, crypto balance, and other details.\nWhat to Look Out For in an NFT Marketplace\nThere are over a hundred NFT marketplaces across several blockchain networks, and choosing one well-suited to your taste can be challenging. Here are four key things you should look at before making your choice:\nBuying and Selling on an NFT Marketplace: The Three C\u0027s\nBefore buying or selling on any marketplace, you need a starter pack–the three C\u0027s.\nNow, you\u0027re ready to make your first purchase or sale.\nStep-by-step Guide on How to Buy and Sell\nNow that you have connected your funded wallet to a marketplace, let\u0027s go through the NFT buying and selling process using AirNFTs as an example.\n1. Go through the Explore page and select your choice of NFT. For a cross-chain NFT marketplace like AirNFTs, you can filter based on the blockchain you want— Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, and Binance Smart Chain. You can also search for a particular artist name, creator, or collection.\n2. Click on the NFT and check its metadata, history, and owner to validate its authenticity.\n3. After verifying the asset\u0027s authenticity, click on buy and approve the transaction on your wallet.\nAnd that\u0027s it! You have just bought your first NFT. You will find your newly purchased NFT sitting comfortably on your profile page.\nNOTE: Another way to buy NFTs is by auction. Keep an eye on the auctions page and make bids for items on sale. Sales here usually have a specific time frame, and the NFT on auction goes to the highest bidder at the end of the sale.\nYou can sell either NFTs you created or bought from another user. Here\u0027s how to sell:\n1. Go to your profile and select the NFT you want to sell.\n2. Choose the type of sale– fixed costs or auctions\n3. Input your price and complete the listing.\nCongrats! Your NFT is on the market, waiting for a potential buyer to snatch it from you.\nNote that there’s a service fee for NFT sales on marketplaces. AirNFTs charges 2.5%.\nTrade NFTs and Earn Crypto with AirNFTs\nAirNFTs makes buying, selling, and creating NFTs on a marketplace incredibly easy. With transactions costing less than a dollar, you can start making money on primary and secondary sales, while also earning passive income on the side.\nVisit our NFT marketplace to start monetizing your digital assets now!\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have taken the world by storm, and NFT marketplaces are where it’s all happening. But what are NFT marketplaces? How do they work? And most importantly, how can you get involved? This blog will give you a quick and easy-to-understand introduction to NFT marketplaces.\nThe Fundamental Concepts of Blockchain technology and NFTs\nNFTs and blockchain technology are two concepts integral to NFT marketplaces\u0027 functioning.\nFirstly, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are unique digital assets that reside on a blockchain network. A blockchain is a decentralized database that stores information in blocks. Each block is assigned a unique code called a hash connected to the previous block. This creates a chain of blocks, hence the term \"blockchain.\"\nThis technology guarantees that data is secure and unalterable, as a network of computers verifies each block before it becomes a part of the chain.\nNFTs use blockchain technology to verify the ownership and legitimacy of digital assets. When an NFT is created, it is assigned a unique token ID that is stored on the blockchain. This token ID acts as a certificate of ownership, ensuring that the NFT cannot be duplicated or counterfeited.\nThe distinctive characteristic of NFTs is that every token is one-of-a-kind and cannot be replicated or exchanged for another. This establishes the authenticity and exclusivity of the asset, adding value for collectors and NFT enthusiasts.\nWhat are NFT Marketplaces?\nNFT Marketplaces are online platforms that allow creators to sell their digital assets, such as art, music, videos, and even tweets, as NFTs. These marketplaces provide a secure and transparent way to buy and sell NFTs, enabling creators to monetize their work and collectors to own unique digital assets.\nWhy do you need an NFT Marketplace?\nAn NFT Marketplace is essential for creators and collectors in the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) space. It serves as a platform for buying and selling unique digital assets, such as artwork, music, videos, and other digital creations that have been tokenized as NFTs on a blockchain.\nHow do NFT Marketplaces work?\nNFT Marketplaces operate on blockchain technology, which ensures that every transaction is recorded on a decentralized ledger that cannot be tampered with.\nNFT Marketplaces also provide a platform for buyers to discover and purchase NFTs that align with their interests. Buyers can search for NFTs by category, popularity, or creator. They can also view the NFT’s ownership history and verify its authenticity before purchasing.\nWhen a creator sells an NFT on a marketplace, the buyer receives a unique digital token representing asset ownership. This token can be stored in a digital wallet and traded on the market or other platforms.\nTypes of NFT Marketplaces\nThere are two main types of NFT Marketplaces: centralized and decentralized.\nCentralized NFT Marketplaces are owned and operated by a single company or organization, which controls the platform and the transactions that take place on it. This type of marketplace is similar to traditional e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and eBay, where buyers and sellers come together to transact. Centralized NFT Marketplaces provide an easier user experience, established trust, and faster transactions. However, they also come with the risk of centralized control, security vulnerabilities, and high fees.\nSome popular centralized NFT Marketplaces include SuperRare, Rarible, and Nifty Gateway.\nDecentralized NFT Marketplaces operate on a blockchain network and do not have a central authority or governing body controlling the transactions. These marketplaces are typically more transparent and secure, as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered or deleted.\nDecentralized NFT Marketplaces also provide low fees and more freedom and autonomy for creators, who can sell their digital assets directly to buyers without needing an intermediary. Transactions are validated by the network of nodes rather than a single entity.\nSome popular decentralized NFT Marketplaces include AirNFTs, OpenSea, and Bored Ape Yacht Club.\nList of Popular NFT Marketplaces\nThere are several NFT Marketplaces that have gained popularity in recent years. Here are some of the most popular NFT Marketplaces:\n‍AirNFTs is one of the space\u0027s simplest and cheapest existing multi-chain NFT Marketplaces, where you can create NFTs on Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), and Fantom (FTM) with only a dollar or less. Our cross-chain marketplace caters to every niche in the digital industry. Among myriads of NFT types, you can create and mint photography NFTs, sports NFTs, music NFTs, video NFTs, Game NFTs, and more.\nThe AirNFTs Marketplace can be accessed on the web, Android, and iOS apps.\nOpenSea is one of the largest NFT Marketplaces, offering a wide range of digital assets, including art, music, videos, and more.\nNifty Gateway is another popular NFT Marketplace that focuses on digital art and collectibles.\nSuperRare is a curated NFT Marketplace that focuses on high-quality digital art.\nRarible is an Ethereum-based platform that facilitates creating, selling, and purchasing ownership rights to digital artworks via non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nBenefits of NFT Marketplaces\nNFT Marketplaces offer several benefits to creators and collectors alike. Here are some of the key advantages:\nChallenges of NFT Marketplaces\nWhile NFT Marketplaces have brought about exciting opportunities for creators and buyers alike, there are several challenges that the industry faces. One of the main challenges is the volatility of NFT prices, which can fluctuate dramatically in a short amount of time.\nAdditionally, concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining and trading have arisen, as the energy required to power these transactions can have a significant carbon footprint.\nFinally, intellectual property (IP rights) and copyright issues related to the ownership and authenticity of NFTs are also a concern. As NFTs become increasingly popular, there’s a risk of counterfeit or fraudulent digital assets being sold on NFT Marketplaces.\nClosing thoughts on The Basics of NFT Marketplaces\nNFT Marketplaces are a new and exciting way for creators to showcase and sell their unique digital assets and for buyers to discover and purchase NFTs that align with their interests. With the rise of NFTs in the art world and beyond, NFT Marketplaces are becoming increasingly popular, and they will continue to play a significant role in the world of digital assets.\nWant to explore more about NFTs?

    "content": "The world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) constantly evolves, and as an NFT enthusiast, you know that staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Whether you want to enhance your NFT collections or differentiate yourself from the competition, AI NFT Generator tools offer a new world of possibilities. In this blog post, we’ll explore eight cutting-edge AI tools that can help you elevate your NFT game, generate unique digital assets, and maximize the value of your NFTs. From predicting market trends to creating standout NFT collections, the following AI NFT creator apps and NFT art generators can help you stand out in a crowded NFT marketplace.\nWhat are AI-Generated NFTs?\nNFTs created through AI software are referred to as AI-generated NFTs. To create these NFTs, the user inputs a prompt, which could be text or image, and the AI program generates an image or a series of images. NFTs have experienced significant growth in recent years, and AI NFTs are poised to become the next big thing. The appeal of AI-generated NFTs lies in their ability to generate new content rapidly based on user input, making the process of creating NFTs faster and more accessible to everyone interested in producing artwork.\nBotto, an AI algorithm, recently made history when its first collection of six non-fungible tokens (NFTs) sold for a whopping $1.3 million on SuperRare. The images created by Botto are reimagined works of famous painters, like Van Gogh and Monet, using VQGan - a machine learning system that generates art by analyzing strings of words or sentences and comparing them to a database of alternative artwork. With AI generators like Botto, individuals can create entire collections of abstract and entirely unique pieces of art with just a few keywords, which can then be minted as NFTs.\nBest AI-Powered NFT Creator Apps and NFT Art Generators\nHere are our top AI art generator picks:\nArt Breeder is one of the top AI art generators that creates new AI art from scratch and allows users to remix existing images to craft new ones. By using its Splicer, you can retouch your old images, edit their features, called genes, and save new ones.\nAlthough users can create images with a free account, only 3 high-resolution images can be downloaded. With subscription packages worth up to $40 annually, users can get extra features such as privacy controls, custom genes, etc.\nMidjourney is an AI-powered platform that generates unique 3D NFTs from user-specified parameters such as shape, texture, and color. It uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create hyper-realistic and unique 3D models.\nWith Midjourney, you can easily convert your 2D sketches into 3D versions using AI technology. This saves you time and eliminates the need to learn complex 3D design software. Similarly, you can also convert 3D models to 2D sketches with ease.\nMidjourney uses Discord as its delivery / creating mechanism - that means you need to have or create a Discord account to even try the service.\nDALL-E is an AI-powered tool developed by OpenAI that generates unique and surreal images from a textual prompt. Named after the iconic artist Salvator Dali, DALL-E can create images of objects, animals, and scenes that do not exist in real life, making it a powerful tool for NFT generation. With DALL-E you can generate a new ai-generated image from a text prompt with full usage rights.\nHere’s an example of a textual description and AI-created images as a response:\nWhile DALL-E is now available to all, it is not entirely free, as it runs on credits. Users get 50 free credits at signup and then 15 per month, but they do not roll over. Paid credits roll over, and you could get 115 credits for $15. Generating AI art per prompt typically produces four new images, which costs a credit, like creating new variants of existing images. You could spend a lot of credits trying to get the right AI-generated image.\nStarryAI is unique among NFT art creation apps as it doesn\u0027t require user input, relying on a machine learning algorithm for output. It offers full ownership of created images for personal and commercial use. While not as advanced as some other AI generators, it\u0027s still better than many others. The service charges a recurring fee, but users can cancel and get a refund if not satisfied.\nStep into the world of digital artistry with the ChainGPT AI NFT Generator!

    "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals, also known as Bitcoin NFTs or Ordinals NFTs, have gained immense popularity with over 123,000 inscriptions now permanently recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. The most coveted tokens and collections with low inscription numbers create a thriving trading and auction market. However, interacting with the Bitcoin chain and obtaining an Ordinal NFT has been challenging due to the slow and centralized technical infrastructure.\nAs the demand for user-friendly interfaces for obtaining Ordinal NFTs grows, web3 developers have stepped up to fill the gap. Several solutions have surfaced in response to this need. In the following section, we will explore these solutions. But first, let’s cover the basics.\nThe Best 3 Bitcoin Ordinals Wallets\nThe recent release of the Ordinals Wallet is a new development in the world of Bitcoin wallets that is specifically designed to manage Ordinal Inscriptions. This wallet, which was launched on February 16, enables users to directly store, view, and hold their Ordinals through the app.\nIn the future, the Ordinals Wallet is planning to introduce additional features that will allow users to transfer, inscribe, send, buy, and sell Ordinals within the wallet. This will create a seamless experience for individuals interested in engaging with the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThe community has warmly received the launch of the Ordinals Wallet, which was previously dissatisfied with existing wallet solutions\u0027 limitations when it came to managing Ordinals. With the dedicated support of this new app, users can conveniently and securely access their Ordinals. While it remains to be seen how the broader cryptocurrency community will react, the Ordinals Wallet is undoubtedly a promising development in the digital asset landscape\u0027s ongoing evolution.\nXverse, a web3 Bitcoin wallet, recently launched its Bitcoin Ordinals service, offering first-class support for Ordinals. Unlike other wallets, Xverse enables users to interact with the blockchain without running a full Bitcoin node. The wallet app also features a fiat on-ramp service, allowing users to purchase Bitcoin to pay transaction fees.\nUsers can upload an image or text to the app and send a transaction to their Ordinal\u0027s address to inscribe an Ordinal NFT. Within half an hour, the NFT will appear in the user\u0027s Xverse NFT collection.\nBefore the release of Xverse and Ordinals Wallet, Hiro Wallet led the way with a testnet rollout on February 14, offering significant support for both Stacks-based NFTs and Ordinal inscriptions. Hiro Wallet intends to release further updates in the coming days.\nGamma.io is used by Hiro Wallet, similar to Xverse, to provide inscription services. When a user inscribes an Ordinal, it is automatically added to their \"Collectibles\" section.‍\n‍The takeaway on Bitcoin Ordinals Wallets\nThe emergence of user-friendly options for Bitcoin Ordinals signals the NFT community\u0027s enthusiasm for this nascent ecosystem. This is an exciting time to witness the growth of a new facet of Web3. We can anticipate more wallets, marketplaces, and user interfaces explicitly tailored to Bitcoin Ordinals in the future.\nStay up-to-date on the latest NFT trends and best practices by following us on social media and keeping an eye on our blog.\nFollow us on\nOrdinal NFTs are non-fungible tokens created by minting unique data onto the Bitcoin blockchain. They are unique digital assets that are each assigned a specific Inscription number. This Inscription number is a unique identifier that distinguishes one Ordinal NFT from another.\nOrdinal NFTs are created on the Bitcoin blockchain with a unique Inscription number that signifies their place in the blockchain\u0027s history. Each NFT is a unique digital asset that cannot be replicated and is recorded and verified through the blockchain\u0027s distributed ledger system. They can be bought and sold on NFT marketplaces for cryptocurrency or other assets, with their value fluctuating based on factors like rarity, uniqueness, and collector demand.\nThe Ordinal protocol makes it possible for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to operate directly on Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain by allowing users to assign whatever content to a Satoshi they please.\nLike NFTs, which are typically linked to the Ethereum network, Ordinal Inscriptions are digital assets that are inscribed on a satoshi, which is the smallest denomination of Bitcoin\nMagic Eden, one of the largest cross-chain NFT platforms, launched a Bitcoin marketplace for Ordinal NFTs on Tuesday, 21 March 2023.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "Are you looking for a way to create and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum (ETH)? Minting NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) can be a lucrative and exciting way to create and trade high-value digital assets. AirNFTs is here to make the process even easier. In this tutorial guide, we will provide a step-by-step walkthrough of creating and minting your own Ethereum NFT via the best Ethereum NFT marketplace. Let’s get started!\nWhat is Ethereum?\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform, most famous for its cryptocurrency token, Ether (ETH). Ethereum allows developers to create and deploy decentralized applications, or DApps, that use smart contracts to manage transactions and other data.\nWhy Ethereum NFT marketplace?\nEthereum is the leading blockchain for NFTs, offering a high level of flexibility and interoperability, allowing developers to build a wide range of digital assets that can be used across different platforms and applications. NFTs were originally created on the Ethereum blockchain, making it the preferred choice for creators looking to mint and sell high-value NFTs.\nBenefits of Creating and Minting Your NFTs on Ethereum\nThere are several significant benefits to minting your NFTs on Ethereum, such as:\nHowever, due to the high volume of network traffic, transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain can increase significantly, causing transaction backlogs.\nCreating an Ethereum NFT via AirNFTs\nWith AirNFTs, digital creators can create and upload a wide range of digital assets, including NFT art, photography NFTs, NFT collectibles, memes, and punks, and list them on the Ethereum blockchain within seconds. The only requirement is that the file format is in JPEG, PNG, MP4, or GIF, and the maximum allowable file size is 8 MB. In addition to the NFT itself, you’ll need an NFT wallet to create and mint your NFT—preferably an Ethereum-compatible wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\nHow to Create Your Own NFTs on Ethereum?\nThe process of tokenizing your digital art on AirNFTs using MetaMask or Trust wallet is identical. Fund your wallet with ETH, then launch the in-app browser and follow the steps outlined below:\n1. Go to www.airnfts.com and click on “Trade NFTs”\n2. Click on “Create”\n3.

Add the Title and Fill in the “Description box”\n5. Enter the price (in ETH), the platform automatically shows the current USD equivalent.\n6. Click “Approve”, pay storage fee (the smaller image the less you pay, consider using tinypng.com) and select “Create” to mint.\n7. After waiting a few seconds, a second screen will appear for paying the network fees to miners who will add your Ethereum NFT to the blockchain.\nCongratulations, you have successfully created and minted your own Ethereum NFT via AirNFTs! Your NFT will now be available for purchase on the Ethereum NFT marketplace.\nConclusion\nCreating and minting your own NFTs on Ethereum via AirNFTs is a straightforward process that can be a profitable and exciting venture. Minting NFTs on AirNFTs is an easy and straightforward process that anyone can do. With the step-by-step guide above, you now have all the information you need to create and sell your own Ethereum NFT.\nStart minting today and earn with Ethereum NFTs Now!\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "Bitcoin NFTs Explained: What are Ordinal NFTs and How to Mint One?",
    "content": "Bitcoin NFTs, also known as Ordinal NFTs or Bitcoin Ordinals, have recently been introduced to the largest crypto network by market capitalization through a new controversial protocol known as the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol.\nSo far, more than 50,000 Bitcoin NFTs have been created on the Bitcoin blockchain. Some of them (such as the Ordinal Punks) have sold for high prices.\nThe launch of the new protocol by Casey Rodarmor, a former Bitcoin Core Contributor, in January has stirred up excitement in the Web3 world. Despite the buzz, the Bitcoin Ordinals project\u0027s popularity has sparked a heated discussion within the Bitcoin community, as not everyone is equally enthusiastic about the innovation.\nAre you wondering how Ordinal NFTs work and how they differ from other NFTs? Do you want to mint your own? Look no further! This article has got you covered.\nWhat are Ordinals NFTs?\nOrdinals are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that you can mint on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, Ordinal Inscriptions aren\u0027t your usual NFTs. Unlike Ethereum NFTs, which depend on off-chain metadata that can be modified. Ordinal Inscriptions are native to Bitcoin, so they don’t require a new or separate side chain or token. Ordinal Inscriptions enable all data to be inscribed directly on-chain.\nWhat is an Ordinal Inscription?\nMinting an NFT on Bitcoin is known as \"inscribing.\" The NFT is referred to as a \"digital artifact.\" Each file is inscribed to individual satoshis, meaning that Ordinals can never go to zero as they are always tied to real sats.\nTo \"inscribe\" a file as an NFT on Bitcoin costs a minimum of 10,000 satoshis (0.0001 BTC) by default. Additionally, you\u0027ll need to pay mining fees based on your image size.\nHow are they different from other NFTs?\nOrdinal NFTs and other NFTs differ primarily in their data storage methods. Most NFTs, including digital art NFTs created using the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard on the Ethereum blockchain, use a metadata file that contains information about the NFT and a link to the file of the artwork stored off the blockchain. In contrast, Ordinal NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain do not use a referenceable metadata file; instead, the entire data file is stored in the witness signature field of Bitcoin transactions, making the NFTs fully embedded in the blockchain. This unique feature of Bitcoin\u0027s Ordinal NFTs enhances their immutability compared to other NFTs.\nHow to mint an Ordinal NFT?\nFor a while, there was no specific wallet interface, such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask, that catered to individuals who wished to store and transfer their Ordinal NFT collections. However, the absence of Web3 infrastructure is no longer a major concern as three wallets, namely Ordinals Wallet, Xverse, and Hiro Wallet, have recently introduced Bitcoin Ordinals-supported features. These wallets are a great starting point if you\u0027re looking to avoid the hassle of creating a separate Bitcoin wallet.\nIf the above options do not appeal to you, you can create a Bitcoin wallet like Sparrow that provides enough customization to receive Ordinal Inscriptions. To get started, visit the Sparrow Wallet website, download the app compatible with your device\u0027s operating system, and follow the on-screen instructions.\nSparrow wallet is a desktop application that requires a handful of steps to make it compatible with Ordinal NFTs. After downloading Sparrow, refer to this Github tutorial to set up an Ordinal-compatible wallet.\nNote: This wallet is only for receiving Ordinal NFTs and not for sending BTC. If you send BTC from this new Ordinals wallet, you may accidentally send both your BTC and your Ordinal(s).\nWith your Ordinal-compatible wallet in place, you have three options for acquiring an Ordinal NFT:\nWhile the technicalities of running a Bitcoin node will not be the focus of this guide, we trust that those who already operate their own node have a good understanding of the necessary concepts.\nInstead, we will concentrate on the second and third options. Keep in mind that the Ordinals market is still in its early stages and carries some degree of risk. Currently, there are no established Bitcoin Ordinals NFT marketplaces yet, so extra caution is necessary when buying and storing Ordinals.\nThe Ordinals market is currently a peer-to-peer over-the-counter (OTC) market. To find Ordinal NFT projects, join the Ordinals Discord channel and go to the \"link-your-project\" channel to see what projects are available. Collection creators will link their Discords, where you can purchase their Ordinals NFTs. Caution is highly advised here as you might have to connect with people on Discord and send money, even before getting an Ordinal.\nSeveral no-code tools have emerged that can create Ordinals on your behalf if you wish to do so without operating a Bitcoin node. Some of these services include Ordinals Bot, created by the Satoshibles NFT collection team, or Gamma\u0027s inscription service offer to inscribe an Ordinal for those who don\u0027t want to run a Bitcoin node. The process involves providing a Bitcoin address and paying a fee, ranging from under $50 in BTC to hundreds of dollars, depending on the file size.\nIf the transaction goes as planned, it may take hours or even days to receive your Ordinal in your wallet, even after sending the required Bitcoin. Be sure to do thorough research and only use reputable services.\nConcerns Surrounding Ordinal NFTs\nThe crypto and DeFi community is highly engaged and passionate about new developments, particularly in regards to NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nOpinions are divided with some predicting that Bitcoin holders will embrace BTC Ordinal NFTs while other Bitcoin enthusiasts believe that this is not in tune with Satoshi’s Bitcoin vision, saying that inscriptions are equivalent to spamming the Bitcoin blockspace.\nConclusion\nBitcoin\u0027s Ordinal NFTs are a thrilling addition to the Web3 realm, yet they are a complex and challenging venture with boundless possibilities. Now, it\u0027s just a matter of how much of an impact they make, and whether or not inscriptions become big enough to attract the same NFT fervor cultivated on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other blockchains.

However, the rise of another disruptive technology, AI or artificial intelligence, is gaining attention, and as NFT enthusiasts, it’s crucial to keep up with its advancements.\nWhat do AI and ChatGPT mean?\nAI refers to Artificial Intelligence, the simulation of human intelligence by computer systems, enabling machines to perform human activities such as thinking, learning, and problem-solving.\nChatGPT, on the other hand, is a text-based AI platform developed by OpenAI.

    "title": "Top 5 NFT Trends To Keep an Eye on In 2023",
    "content": "After experiencing a massive surge in 2021, with approximately 1.5 million NFT art sales, the NFT market faced myriad challenges in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, primarily caused by significant declines in volume at the macro level from the previous year.\nOn the other hand, 2022 was also a year with some substantial innovations and progress toward the future of Web3. For investors familiar with the digital economy, or those hoping to incorporate NFTs into their portfolio, there are several NFT trends to be aware of as we move into 2023. This blog explores five of them, namely: Artificial Intelligence (AI), NFT Ticketing, NFT Gaming, Fractional NFTs and Music NFTs.\nThis is by no means a definitive list of trends that will emerge. It\u0027s a fun look at some areas that may be attracting market attention in 2023.\nOverview of the 5 NFT trends to watch out for in 2023\n1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in NFTs\nThe intersection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) is an exciting area to watch in 2023. One potential use case for NFTs and AI is the creation of unique, AI-generated art NFTs and collectibles. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, artists and collectors can create one-of-a-kind digital works encoded on the blockchain as NFTs. This allows the creation of truly unique and scarce digital assets and opens up new possibilities for AI-powered art auctions and NFT marketplaces.\nAnother potential use case for NFTs and AI is in the area of virtual reality (VR). By combining NFTs with VR technology, users can create and sell unique, immersive experiences backed by the blockchain\u0027s security and immutability. This could include everything from virtual reality concerts and events to virtual real estate.\n2. NFT Ticketing\nThe use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for ticketing is an exciting possibility for 2023 and beyond. Using NFTs to represent event tickets, organizers can take advantage of the security and immutability of the blockchain to prevent ticket fraud and scalping. NFT tickets can also be easily transferable, allowing fans to easily buy and sell tickets among themselves or on the secondary market.\nIn addition to the benefits for event organizers and attendees, using NFTs for ticketing could open up new revenue streams for artists and events. For example, NFT tickets could include exclusive perks or experiences, such as meet-and-greets or backstage access, that could be sold at a premium price.\n3. NFT Gaming\nBy using NFTs to represent in-game items, players can own unique, scarce assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs. This not only adds a new level of scarcity and value to in-game items, but also allows for the creation of a vibrant secondary market for these assets.\n4. Fractional NFTs (F-NFT)\nFractional NFTs, also known as fractional ownership NFTs, are non-fungible tokens that represent partial ownership of a real-world or digital asset. They allow multiple parties to jointly own a single asset and share in the rights, benefits, and costs associated with ownership.\nFractional NFTs may become more prevalent and widely accepted as a way to own and trade a wide range of assets fractionally.\nSome potential uses for fractional NFTs in 2023 could include the following:\nNew and innovative uses for fractional NFTs will emerge as the technology and market continue to evolve.\n5. NFT Music\nAnother trend to watch is the use of NFTs to represent music ownership. By using NFTs to represent ownership of a particular song or album, artists can create a new way for fans to support their work and create a new revenue stream for themselves. This could disrupt the traditional music industry business model and give artists more control over their music.\nAirNFTs is one of the best music NFT marketplaces for musicians entering this world for the first time. The low cost of entry is a critical factor in attracting customers and creators.\nHow to promote your NFT project in 2023?\nChoosing the right NFT marketplace is crucial when deciding how you want to promote your NFT project.

    "title": "The Role of NFTs in Healthcare",
    "content": "The healthcare industry has been forced into a state of constant, rapid innovation, no thanks to the pandemic. Frontline researchers have kept exploring new dawns in the hopes of evolving from the remains of the covid impact. Asides from the esoteric clinical and laboratory trials, several areas in medical science need to be improved to enhance healthcare delivery. Let\u0027s look at some examples of where NFTs in healthcare can work.\nA closer look at the roles of NFTs in the Healthcare field\nThe most important thing in the healthcare industry is keeping accurate and up-to-date records. This is especially true for medical records, which must be comprehensive and easily accessible to provide the best possible care for patients. Imagine being on vacation in another country and getting over a health-related challenge because your medical records can be easily accessed as NFTs on the blockchain. Or have a quick medical intervention because your medical records have been input into the blockchain from the outset.\nUsing NFTs in healthcare could revolutionize operations, especially in telemedicine, making it easier for doctors and other healthcare professionals to access the information they need and give quick yet accurate treatment without repeating diagnoses.\nIn the age of big data, data ownership has become a hot topic. From social media platforms collecting our data to companies using our genomic information, we are losing control of our personal information. NFTs solve this problem by protecting patients’ sensitive information and improving privacy and security.\nThe NFT’s advantage of uniqueness and non-fungibility makes them perfect for storing sensitive and personal data like genomic information. Tokenizing data means individuals can be sure that their data is secure and only accessible to those they trust. Also, NFTs allow individuals to monetize their genomic data. For example, they could sell access to their NFT to research organizations or companies developing new treatments using an NFT marketplace. In this way, NFTs could help people profit from their data while maintaining control over it.\nRecently, there has been increasing interest in tokenizing medical equipment, especially in third-world countries. Creating a transparent way to validate the authenticity of the medical equipment — from simple blood sugar devices to complex surgical machines— will improve the existing trust issues in medical practice. This will reduce the preponderance of fake equipment and, consequently, the rate of iatrogenic errors contributing to patient morbidity and mortality.\nWhat’s more, tokenized medical devices can be traded on reputable NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs.\nNFTs in healthcare can also enhance management. As crucial as consultations, clinical, and laboratory research are, sustainability is driven by proper management— of resources, people, inflows, outflows, etc. Asides from safe record-keeping of hospital finances, equipment, aid devices, and medications with their real-time prices can be tokenized. Hospitals can also augment staff identification processes with NFT collections. All of these can help with decision-making and bolster more accommodative policies in the healthcare sector.\nConclusion: Will NFTs in healthcare work?\nThe improvements we hope to see in the medical industry are possible but will require time and a lot of collaboration between medical and blockchain experts. As healthcare restructuring moves forward it is hoped that NFTs can be explored in the relevant settings.\nCheck out the blog to catch up on our NFT use case series.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "title": "Custodial \u0026 Non-custodial Crypto Wallets Explained",
    "content": "Choosing between a custodial crypto wallet and a non-custodial crypto wallet is critical when securing your cryptocurrency holdings. Some users prefer a custodial wallet, others prefer non-custodial wallets, and some end up using a combination of the two.\nNevertheless, non-custodial crypto wallets keep gaining traction as decentralized finance is growing. But how is a non-custodial wallet different from a custodial wallet, and why do most crypto users prefer non-custodial crypto wallets? Let’s find out together!\nHow are they different?\nThe main difference between a custodial crypto wallet and a non-custodial crypto wallet is “ownership.”\nA non-custodial wallet enables users to have complete ownership of their cryptocurrencies, and as a user, you are the one who stores your private keys. The name derives from the fact that the wallet doesn’t have custody of your crypto assets but rather serves as an interface that enables you to easily and conveniently access it at all times.\nOn the other hand, a custodial wallet offers services that protect and store your cryptocurrencies for you. In other words, custodial wallets control your private keys and hold your cryptocurrencies in custody. If you don\u0027t mind a third party between you and your crypto, there are plenty of options for custodial wallet providers. Most companies providing custodial wallet services are well-known and established cryptocurrency exchanges.\nSome of the best examples of custodial wallets include the Coinbase wallet, Binance wallet, BitMex wallet, Free wallet, and BitGo cryptocurrency wallet.\nBenefits of a non-custodial crypto wallet\n1. Complete control over private keys\nThe main reason non-custodial crypto wallets are gaining huge traction is that they offer users the ability to exercise greater control over who has access to their funds. The user retains complete control and ownership of their cryptocurrencies and has individual access to their funds. Users do not need to go to third-party providers to manage their funds or perform any related activities.\n2. No KYC or any kind of verification process\nNon-custodial wallets do not require documentation to trade or store crypto. In other words, as a user, you don\u0027t need to provide your ID or passport to use the wallet.\n3. No transactions limitations\nMost custodial wallets require you to wait anywhere from 24 hours to a few days for withdrawals to be processed. Regarding non-custodial wallets, transactions are usually unlimited in size or speed. No holding periods, and your crypto assets cannot be frozen or limited in any way, as is often the case with custodial wallets.\nWhat are the best non-custodial wallets to store your crypto coins and NFTs?\nNon-custodial crypto wallets to consider:\n1. Trust Wallet\nTrust Wallet is a diverse non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, with support for over 1 million different cryptocurrencies across more than 50 blockchains. Previously only available on mobile devices, the Trust Wallet browser extension is now available with integrations with Binance Pay and Coinbase Pay. The new browser extension lets users send and receive crypto across all EVM chains and Solana. Through the app, Trust Wallet users can buy cryptocurrency, send and receive coins, and buy and sell NFTs.\nIf you\u0027re a beginner to cryptocurrencies or NFTs, Trust Wallet is a highly recommended option to get started.\n2. Airnfts Wallet\nThe AirNFTs crypto wallet will be entirely non-custodial and is currently in the works. It will support different cryptocurrencies such as Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and many other tokens that live on these networks. Unlike other wallets, it will have NFT support and enable users to mint and trade NFTs directly inside the wallet. Additionally, Airnfts wallet will not track user-sensitive information such as IP addresses or other private information.\n3. Rainbow Wallet\nRainbow is a mobile wallet for Ethereum, available on iOS and currently in public beta on Android. It is non-custodial, meaning you are in control of your private keys, thus your funds. It only supports Ethereum but shows the most important data of your NFTs, such as the floor price for collection and the NFTs you bought.\n4. Gem Wallet\nGem Wallet is a non-custodial privacy and security focused crypto wallet app for digital assets such as BNB, ETH, BTC and other virtual commodities, and NFTs. You are solely in control of and responsible for your digital assets and private keys. Gem Wallet is an open-source wallet owned by the community.\n5. Phantom Wallet\nPhantom is the main digital wallet for the Solana blockchain and has the biggest Solana NFT support out of all wallets if you want to dive into Solana NFTs. Phantom is a hot, non-custodial crypto wallet: Hot wallets are online wallets connected to the internet, in contrast to cold wallets that are offline.\nThe takeaway on Custodial \u0026 Non-custodial crypto wallets\nThe choice between a non-custodial and a custodial crypto wallet depends mainly on which wallet features are most important to you. It all comes down to the question: do you want to take full ownership and control of your private keys and digital assets, or do you want someone else to do it for you?\nBoth types of wallets have pros and cons, so weigh your comfort level with the features that matter most to you before deciding.\nKeep an eye on our blog and follow our socials for more updates.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "NFTs and Supply Chain Management",
    "content": "Supply chain management (SCM) is a complex sequence of activities that involves getting a raw product to the end consumer in its finished state. In any industry, optimizing systems and processes is no easy task– from material handling and distribution to information management. NFTs can potentially reduce the pain points in the complex supply chain sector. But first, what are the current challenges?\nIn our increasingly globalized and interconnected world, the origin of the products we purchase can be hard to trace. The supply chain in any industry is complex and spans multiple countries, making the authentication process even more demanding. Existing solutions like QR codes that have helped reduce counterfeit products are still subject to manipulation. Unsuspecting buyers can divulge valuable information via QR codes and possibly suffer incalculable losses.\nAs any business owner knows, supply chain management is essential for keeping costs down and ensuring that products are delivered on time. However, achieving efficiency in the supply chain is often easier said than done. Several factors impact efficiency, including the number of suppliers, the location of suppliers, and the type of products being transported. In addition, disruptions in the supply chain can often lead to significant delays and cost increases.\nTrust is crucial in any business transaction, and the cost of trust for a supply chain with several moving parts is remarkably high. Operations are mostly non-transparent, and end users rely on governing authorities to ascertain quality. The supply chain industry\u0027s current scope needs to consider the increased consumer demand for transparency.\nRedefining Supply Chain with NFTs\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) can transform the supply chain industry in the following ways:\nNFTs, using the underlying blockchain, can be used in supply chain management to provide a secure and efficient way to track and manage assets. With NFTs in the supply chain, each asset can be given a unique identifier that can be used to track the asset through the supply chain. This will allow for more efficient and accurate tracking of assets, which will, in turn, lead to a more efficient and effective supply chain overall.\nNFTs are non-interchangeable assets. This makes them well-suited for tracking the ownership and provenance of physical goods. For example, an NFT could represent a shipment of coffee beans, with each package represented by a unique token. By tracking the movement of these tokens through the supply chain, it would be possible to build a complete picture of where the beans have been and who has handled them.\nThe growing consumer demand for transparency can be met through NFTs and smart contracts. Users can check a product\u0027s history, and anyone with an internet-enabled phone can verify real-time information.\nConclusion\nSupply chain management (SCM) is one of the fields where NFTs can thrive. With the success of Walmart’s venture into blockchain to track a Chinese Pork supply chain, more businesses using NFTs and smart contracts to manage their operations are not so far off.\nKeep an eye on our blog for the following piece on our NFT use case series.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "title": "The Role of NFTs in Education",
    "content": "Non-fungible tokens have gained relevance in recent years through digital art. Several collectors and creators have made fortunes with them. In just a few years, the technology has spread to a vast network of creators, companies, brands, and celebrities who trade huge volumes in various markets. However, with the growth in market volumes come pressing questions about the long-term value proposition of NFTs. It is worth asking if digital arts is all there is to this nascent technology, and this piece will provide some answers.\nA closer look at the roles of NFTs in Education\n1. Issuance of certificates\nCertified qualifications are vital to every firm or institution primarily because they are proof of the bearer\u0027s competence. The major problem with certificates nowadays is their authenticity. Fake certificates are fast becoming a norm, and anyone with good graphic design skills can forge one within minutes. While this might not mean much for some roles where the certificate bearer can learn on the job, the effects might be devastating for others where laser precision is needed.\nHow, then, do we tackle this problem of certificate issuance? The existing solution involves getting letters from several offices to verify authenticity, but this method is time-consuming and inefficient. Thanks to the underlying tech, a modern world where institutions create blockchain-based systems to issue certificates as NFTs is not hard to imagine. These certificates can not be tampered with, and anyone that cares–including employers– can view and verify their authenticity at any time.\n2. Preservation of records\nRecord keeping is an age-long sector that can be improved upon by NFTs and its underpinning technology–blockchain. Keeping paper records is a risk-– things happen beyond our control, often coming unannounced. Disasters, natural or otherwise, can be devastating, destroying everything in their wake, including certificates. If things like that happen, what do you do? Getting copies of their certificates is tedious, but all this stress can be avoided by having your certificates as NFTs. Schools and colleges will have reduced paperwork, and students can keep records of their degrees from the beginning of their education to their current level. Institutions that have scaled up to digitizing records are still plagued with security issues such as hacks, record manipulations, etc. Creating a blockchain-based record-keeping platform solves these, as technical blockchain networks are technically impossible to hack into. Even if a nation\u0027s educational system collapses, the blockchain records of their certificate can keep their credentials.\n3. Protecting intellectual property\nIntellectual theft is prevalent in academic circles, which is pitiful, considering the time and resources put into making some inventions. Licenses and patents can be stored on the blockchain as NFTs. This way, inventors can defend their intellectual property because of the time stamps on digital assets. Research can also be crowd-funded, with each investor owning a piece of NFT to show financial collaboration in the research work.\nConclusion\nNFTs in education might sound bizarre initially, but taking a step further makes you realize the gaps in the existing system for which they are an ideal fit. They have the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and how we assess learning outcomes. They can also help to create more secure and efficient systems for managing educational data. Hopefully, in a few years, institutions will explore NFTs and other blockchain-based solutions for their online ventures.\nAirNFTs is a non-custodial NFT marketplace driving NFT adoption across industries.

    "title": "NFT Renting Explained",
    "content": "If you\u0027ve been in the NFT space for a while, you know that buying and collecting NFTs is never cheap. Even the cheapest NFTs from popular NFT projects, such as Cryptopunks or Bored Apes, are not sold at a price the average collector can afford. This is where NFT renting comes in, giving you the benefits of having an NFT (as well as the utilities that come with it) for a limited period without the financial commitment of investing in it. Let’s explore this concept together.\nWhat is NFT renting?\nNFT renting is where individuals who do not own or possess a particular NFT but wish to utilize its utility or experience it for a brief time borrow the NFT from a relevant NFT renting protocol.\nNFT rental marketplaces use Defi blockchain technologies to facilitate secure transactions and ensure that the NFT returns to its owner at the end of the rental period.\nWhy would someone rent an NFT?\nThe answer is simple: to make money. For the lender, NFT renting creates a financial revenue stream by allowing them to earn money passively to use their NFTs.\nFrom the borrower’s standpoint, it opens an opportunity to join the NFT community. In addition, renting NFTs is an inexpensive way to enjoy the benefits of some of the high-end NFT utilities without making a significant initial investment.\nOn the other hand, some people may only need or want to use an NFT for a specific purpose and time. In this case, renting allows them access to the NFT when needed.\nThe potential for NFT renting could be enormous. Digital art, metaverse lands, and in-game assets such as characters and weapons are prime candidates for NFT rental. For play-to-earn projects, renting game assets could temporarily allow the player to increase their earning power. An effective rental system could also enable these earnings to be shared with the lender, providing an additional source of passive income.\nHow does NFT renting work?\nThere are two main types of NFT renting: Collateral renting and non-collateral or collateral-less renting.\nThis renting involves a renter or borrower providing collateral to use someone else\u0027s NFT temporarily. NFT owners can list their NFTs on an NFT rental platform such as IQ Protocol, and borrowers who like the NFT then initiate the borrowing process, during which the asset goes into an NFT rental smart contract.\nTo protect the lender\u0027s interests, the borrower must deposit collateral of a higher price point than the NFT. The borrower also has to pay a certain sum as a rental fee. After the contract expires, the NFT is returned to the original owner, and the borrower will get their collateral back.\nHowever, there are potential risks with the collateral model:\nCollateral-less or collateral-free renting follows a similar path to the collateral model and offers significant benefits to both the asset owner and the borrower. The sole difference is that, unlike collateral renting, the renter or borrower doesn’t get the original NFT. Instead, a wrapped NFT with all the exact characteristics of the original asset is minted for them.\nOnce the contract expires, the wrapped NFT is burned. The renter or borrower does not have to put up any collateral, and the owner or lender does not have to part with their original asset. This minimizes financial risks for both parties.\nHow to make money renting NFTs?\nIf you have high-demand or popular digital assets, renting NFTs can help you generate passive income. Also, this concept is trendy if you play NFT \"play-to-earn\" games because many NFT games require a substantial upfront investment before you can start making money.\nOne solution would be to buy the NFTs needed for these games and lend them to players who can\u0027t afford to buy them but still want to play. In this case, these NFTs would be in-game assets, such as characters or virtual lands, that would give players a competitive advantage during the game. In exchange for renting NFTs, players give you the agreed amount of crypto.\nWhat are the best NFT rental marketplaces where you can rent NFTs?\nNFT renting platforms to keep an eye on:\nThe Takeaway on NFT Renting\nNFT rental will only evolve and grow with time, with the demand for NFT rental marketplaces being tied to liquidity and financial use cases. Moreover, NFT renting will empower those wishing to participate in the web3 evolution, whether they own a digital asset or do not have the financial ability to buy them.\nAt AirNFTs, we want to help you learn as much as possible about the upcoming NFT revolution.

    "content": "Ever had to get a refund from your airline for canceled flights? Or probably couldn’t meet up to a hotel reservation and lost all chances of a refund? These are two of many frustrating situations in the travel industry. Not only are they tiresome for travelers, but businesses also have to deal with refunds and compensations. What if there was an efficient way to pay for travel expenses without fear of losing out entirely if an emergency prevents you from making the trip? Perhaps NFTs can be an unlikely answer to the challenges facing the travel industry. Keep reading to learn about how this is possible.\nCurrent Setbacks\nThe travel industry is recently making a comeback from the coronavirus pandemic. Operations that were erstwhile quick are now being a recalibration of customers’ sentiments toward traveling. It is unlikely that things will be different than before the pandemic.\nBooking all you need for a vacation can be stressful, and there are dedicated professionals to ensure you don’t go through the stress. Online bookings have made things easier for travelers, but demand more commissions from hotels. Apart from these, bookings don’t go through as expected, leaving the travelers stranded.\nIn the past, many people stuck with the same travel company when planning a vacation. However, in recent years, there has been a shift toward increased competition and decreased customer loyalty within the travel industry. This is because of several factors; The rise of online booking platforms makes it easy for consumers to compare prices and find the best deals, and the growth of the sharing economy, like Airbnb, has made it possible for people to find alternative accommodations that are often more affordable than traditional hotels.\nTravel companies face challenges in retaining customers and generating repeat business due to these changes. To adapt to the changing landscape, companies must focus on providing an exceptional customer experience while offering competitive prices.\nWhere do NFTs come in?\nLeveraging its underpinning tech–blockchain, NFTs in travel will transform several operations, three of which are:\nNFTs are an ideal platform for managing bookings, as they can help to streamline the process and reduce the time and effort required. In particular, they can help track bookings, confirm availability, and process payments. As a result, they have the potential to make booking methods more efficient and reduce the cost and complexity of the process. In addition, NFTs are highly secure, which can help protect against fraud and ensure that bookings are processed safely.\nThe secure and transparent nature of NFTs makes them suitable for building trust in the travel industry. Customers can easily view their loyalty cards on the blockchain and see the perks they are eligible for repeated patronage. NFTs should also be transferable in the likely event that one’s trip is postponed or outrightly canceled. This way, the hotels do not have to pay refunds, and the traveler still gets value for his NFTs. Hotels can also use this to improve their brand marketing strategies.\nPeople are wired to associate with communities; otherwise, Discord servers and Telegram pages will not be sprouting up every other second. While most of these communities usually trade hopes and promises, NFTs in the travel industry will be completely different. Travel brands can create their NFT ecosystem where users identify with and interact with their features. The NFTs will also be interoperable with third-party marketplaces to increase liquidity.\nLuggage often changes hands when traveling, and missing luggage is not a rarity. With a decentralized database like where NFTs are built, tracking luggage positions can be easier and less laborious.\nNFTs in travel can also be utilized as an incentive system for rewarding customers who complete tasks such as visiting certain places and providing information about them.\nTake Home\nFrom sports to media and gamefi NFTs, there is an increasing list of technologies adopting web3 products to upscale their operations, and the travel industry will be a crucial addition. Introducing NFTs in travel will reduce pain points on the business owners’ side and create a customer-centric business approach, which has always proven to result in profitability.\nAirNFTs is poised to drive blockchain adoption across industries and create a non-custodial NFT marketplace (read as home) where everyone can interact and trade NFTs seamlessly.

Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator.

    "title": "IP Rights and NFTs - What You Should Know",
    "content": "Blockchain technology is changing the world. It has given rise to a whole new class of investment opportunities, including non-fungible tokens, better known as NFTs, that have been making headlines since they went mainstream in 2021. NFT use cases and their high purchase prices are some factors that drove adoption and NFT popularity over the past year.\nHowever, behind these attention-grabbing NFT deals are NFT intellectual property considerations, such as NFT patent or NFT copyright, that NFT creators and collectors (brands included) must consider. A report found that of the 25 most valuable NFT projects, only one collection attempts to provide buyers with intellectual property rights to the original art. The rest confuse buyers and reserve the right to change the usage license to their NFT collections anytime. This article explores the usage and intellectual property aspects of an NFT.\nWhat is Intellectual Property (IP)?\nIntellectual property (IP), as defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These works are protected by laws that prevent others from profiting or taking undue credit for something they did not create.\nThere are three common types of intellectual property protected by law:\nPatent law applies to inventions of some public utility. Copyright applies to literary and artistic works such as books and music. Trademark law is generally associated with the business world and involves the branding of a person\u0027s goods or services to distinguish them from other businesses.\nWhile laws protect these types of intellectual property, enforcing them remains a challenge in blockchain-based creations, where NFTs are sometimes made from stolen artworks, and issues of ownership rights have resulted in court cases with obscure resolutions.\nWho owns the Intellectual Property rights of an NFT?\nThere needs to be more clarity about what intellectual property rights a buyer acquires when purchasing an NFT. After spending a significant amount of money to obtain it, it is understandable that some buyers think they are also receiving the NFT patent or NFT copyright.\nIn reality, they generally do NOT gain any NFT intellectual property rights or commercial rights when buying NFTs. The NFT copyright ownership naturally belongs to the creator, and unless and until it is assigned to the new buyer, it remains the creator\u0027s property.\nAs an NFT buyer, you should familiarize yourself with different types of NFT licensing rights and understand who owns the IP of an NFT:\nThis type of license indicates that you are not allowed to monetize the artwork in any way and that you also have limited display rights.\nVeefriends is an example of an \"NFT collection for personal use only.\" Its terms and conditions state that \"unless otherwise specified, your purchase of a Vee Friends NFT does not give you the right to display, perform, distribute, sell or publicly reproduce the VFNFT or its contents for commercial purposes.\"\nUnless specific terms and conditions grant certain rights, a buyer does NOT have copyright in the NFT purchased. In most cases, it is only the ownership of a specific copy of the NFT that is acquired, the privilege of being registered (or more accurately, having a designated wallet registered) as the actual owner of the NFT on the blockchain, the right to brag to the world that they own an NFT.‍\nA commercial license allows a creator to assign a buyer the right to monetize the NFT while retaining ownership and control of the NFT intellectual property.\nThe buyer must pay royalties to the original NFT creator in some commercial licensing structures. The original creator often sets this percentage, usually calculated per sale.\nHowever, a royalty-free license bypasses these requirements. Solana-based Magic Eden has become the latest NFT marketplace to switch to an optional royalty model, following in the footsteps of X2Y2 in August.\nUnder the optional royalty model, buyers can set the royalties they wish to pay to an NFT project, meaning that some creators may not receive royalties when their work is sold.\nHow to determine NFT ownership rights?\nUsually, the only way to know what property rights you are buying is by visiting the NFT project\u0027s website and finding and reviewing the project\u0027s terms and conditions.\nHere is one example of NFT licensing terms:\n“For NBA Top Shot NFTs, NBA only grants buyers a limited, personal, non-commercial license to use. Buyers cannot modify the assets, cannot use the assets for commercial purposes (e.g., making advertisements containing the assets), cannot produce merchandise, etc.”\nBuyers are required to follow specific rules in the use of the assets. This is usually the case for NFTs created by major brands.\nAre there any NFT projects with IP rights?\nSome of today\u0027s biggest and most popular NFT collections, including Bored Ape Yacht Club, have assigned full intellectual property rights to users. It effectively means that those who own Bored Ape NFTs have the potential to profit from them.\nThe takeaway on NFTs and Intellectual Property rights\nWithin the NFT space, each NFT project has different intellectual property licenses for users, and very few offer IP rights to the NFT holder. Therefore, reading the small print to find and understand what you’re getting is essential.\nKeep an eye on our blog and follow our socials for more updates!\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

If you haven\u0027t followed closely, you might be confused about where to start. Well, here\u0027s another shot at starting your foray into the NFT market.\nBut first, some background…\nAirNFTs is the simplest and cheapest existing NFT marketplace right now. You can create NFTs on Polygon, Fantom, and Binance chains with only a dollar or less. Our cross-chain marketplace caters to every niche in the digital industry. Among myriads of NFT types, you can create photography NFTs, sports NFTs, music NFTs, video NFTs, and Game NFTs.\nYou can access our NFT marketplace on the web and Android mobile app. The iOS version of our NFT app is coming very soon.\nNFT marketplace Features\nLet\u0027s walk you through the available features on the app:\nThink of the explore page as the main dashboard for all kinds of appealing NFTs for your viewing and purchase.

Each NFT has metadata — the name, owner, history, date minted, ID, the mint transaction number, and contract address.\nCollections are a group of NFTs with a similar theme but unique traits. The collections page shows the collections\u0027 data: number, owners, volumes, and floor price.\nHot auctions work similarly to conventional auction sales intending to foster free and fair competition among bidders. You can check the page periodically to see items up for auction.

These digital assets can include everything from digital art and music to virtual real estate and in-game items.\nNFT marketplaces operate on a blockchain network, which ensures the security and transparency of transactions. When a user wants to sell an NFT, they create a digital certificate that verifies ownership of the asset and records it on the blockchain. Buyers can then purchase the NFT using cryptocurrency, and the ownership of the digital asset is transferred to the new owner.\nAlmost any type of digital asset can be sold in an NFT marketplace, as long as it is unique and has value. This can include digital art, music, videos, tweets, virtual real estate, in-game items, and more.\nTo buy an NFT, you will need a digital wallet that supports the blockchain network on which the NFT was created. Once you have a digital wallet, you can browse NFT marketplaces and purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nOnce you own an NFT, you can keep it as a digital asset, sell it on a marketplace, or trade it for another NFT. You can also display your NFT in a virtual gallery or showcase it on social media.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "New NFT Projects For November 2022",
    "content": "While old NFT projects like CryptoPunks, Axie Infinity, Moonbirds NFT, or the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT are already well established, many other projects are emerging within the NFT space. Thousands of new NFT projects are launching daily on various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, OpenSea, or Rarible.\nAre you looking for the best new NFT projects to follow and potentially invest in? This article explores the top 6 new NFT projects to buy in 2022 for high long-term returns.\nThe top new NFT projects coming out in 2022\nThe new NFT projects listed below have been launched or will be launched in 2022.\n1. Copium Protocol\nCopium Protocol is a multi-pronged mining investment project based on the Ethereum blockchain. The Copium Investor Pass, a collection of 10,000 NFTs that will be minted on the Ethereum blockchain in early to mid-October, will be sold as the initial offering of the project. Therefore, investors must purchase a pass if they want to use the Copium protocol and enjoy its benefits. Notably, the first 2,000 users to register on the project\u0027s website will receive a guaranteed mint spot for a lower fixed price of only 3 ETH. Investor Pass NFT holders will also be eligible for a unique drop of 10,000 Copium Coins, the native ERC-20 token that powers the ecosystem.\nThe Copium Protocol has developed an innovative solution to create an ecosystem that generates value for everyone involved through passive crypto mining. If you have the NFT Investor Pass or a bag of Copium coins, you will benefit in the long run from the maturity of the ecosystem and the shrinking supply of Copium coins.\n2. Seedify\nSeedify is one of the cryptocurrency industry’s leading launchpads and notable incubators. They empower innovators and project developers through access to funding and community and partnership building. They provide a complete support system to help bring top blockchain games, NFTs, and metaverses to their community through IGOs (Initial Gaming Offerings) and INOs (Initial NFTs Offerings).\nDespite the current market condition with bear run, Seedify successfully launched their $SNFTS token (the Seedify NFT Marketplace token) via an airdrop on 31 August 2022. Seedify will focus on two business niches: blockchain gaming and the metaverse. Each with utility-based NFTs, which are imperative for sustainability and growth.\nThe $SNFTS staking and farming pools were made available immediately after the release. Once the holder has claimed their $SNFTS, they can stake and farm and begin earning passive income immediately.\nHolders are also entitled to other benefits of $SNFTS, such as reduced fees and random NFT drops for those trading on Seedify\u0027s upcoming NFT marketplace. They will also be entitled to whitelist spots for Seedify\u0027s exclusive NFT Avatar collection, which was recently announced.\n‍3. Battle Infinity – An exciting new metaverse-based NFT project\nBattle Infinity (IBAT) is an exciting new NFT project with enormous potential. An NFT play-to-earn-based Metaverse gaming ecosystem consisting of six unique platforms, Battle Infinity is a diverse and incredibly feature-rich NFT project that could reshape the industry. CoinSniper has already verified it, and the project\u0027s Telegram group is rapidly gaining a following, making it one of the best new NFT projects to watch.\nThe Battle Infinity ecosystem includes an NFT marketplace, a staking platform, a fantasy sports platform, a series of P2E games, a beautifully designed Metaverse, and a decentralized exchange. With all this in one new NFT project, Battle Infinity truly has something for everyone and looks set to dominate the NFT space.\nBEP-20 $IBAT is the project\u0027s native token and will be used to power everything in the ecosystem. With a limited supply of 10 billion tokens, it will be used to reward qualified players, earn revenue by staking on IBAT Battle Stake, and purchase virtual advertising space.\n4. Lucky Block NFTs – New Popular NFT Project with Jackpots\nLucky Block is a platform for NFT competitions. Players can earn rewards from LBLOCK tokens by holding NFTs and participating in contests. The launch of the Lucky Block Platinum Rollers Club NFT collection (a collection of 10,000 NFTs hosted on Binance Smart Chain) has created a massive buzz among LBLOCK holders and early investors. Like the LBLOCK token, the Lucky Block NFT Collection is also expected to see a price increase in 2022 and beyond. If the NFT collection is as successful as the token, an investment of $1,000 will yield $100,000! Unlike most NFTs available on marketplaces, such as AirNFTs and others, the Lucky Block NFT collection has an added benefit. Anyone with at least one NFT from the collection gets a lifetime entry into the daily NFT drawings. Each reward can win you $10,000, and the luckiest players will receive one of 25 rare NFTs. Recently, the platform has been featured on TV shows and other media outlets worldwide. The media is interested in the project, which will drive the value of tokens and NFTs.\n5. Tamadoge\nLaunched in July 2022, Tamadoge is a metaverse project that received exciting reviews in the NFT space after raising $19 million in a monster pre-sale in Q3 2022. It\u0027s a play-to-earn NFT game with a metaverse where users can breed their pets (doges) to rise to the leaderboard. Users will also be allowed to use the TAMA token to cash in crypto rewards. Unlike traditional meme coins, Tamadoge will focus much more on providing utility to investors via a play-to-earn game mechanism and NFTs.\nOver time the play-to-earn opportunities on Tamadoge will expand to include augmented reality experiences, allowing your NFT to play with its friends in the Tamaverse.\n6. Silks – A derivatives-based NFT P2E metaverse that replicates real-world horse racing\nSilks is a new NFT project that is getting a lot of attention. Silks is a blockchain-based metaverse that allows users to own, trade, and earn rewards through thoroughbred racehorses. This exciting project is based on real-world events, which means that all of the \"virtual horses\" in the game have a real-world equivalent. Ultimately, this allows metaverse participants to benefit from the performance of real-world horses in races. Silks, also home to the top NFT Land projects and the top NFT horse racing projects, is a top-notch NFT project worth considering.\nThe virtual world underlies the Silks project, allowing users to purchase land parcels and build stables to house their horses. Notably, these plots of land are structured as NFTs, which can be monetized and traded on the Silks marketplace. Horses are also structured as NFTs, with new pools of horses being minted yearly to coincide with the trade of \"Yearlings\" in the real world.\nA promising long-term prospect for NFTs is that horse racing does well in all market conditions, including recessions. Therefore, NFT derivatives can be expected to mimic the real-world economics of horse racing somewhat.\nOverall, Silks NFTs are a great project to buy for high long-term returns in 2022. The NFTs provided by Silks are new, and they bridge the gap between the natural world and the cryptocurrency industry, making them very valuable.\nHow to find new NFT projects early?\nOne of the best ways to find the best new NFT projects is to use a reliable NFT calendar and to check the top NFT marketplaces, such as AirNFTs, so you don\u0027t miss out on new and upcoming NFT drops.\nDetermining what makes a great NFT project or a worthy investment is complex. While there are still a handful of fantastic NFT projects to buy in 2022 for high long-term returns, we hope this guide helps inform your choices.\nDisclaimer: AirNFTs does not guarantee, warrant, or necessarily endorse the above projects and is not responsible for them in any way.

    "title": "NFT Trends For Q4 2022",
    "content": "Trends are nothing new in the financial markets, let alone in the digital arts and collectibles space. After last year\u0027s nuclear spike in NFT prices and activity, the Federal Reserve\u0027s 2020 quantitative easing effectively lowered the pace and relegated other traditional financial industries to months of corrections. Wondering if there\u0027s still hope for the NFT market in 2022? Read on.\nOverview of the last Quarter for NFTs in 2022\nLiquidity is core to the sustainability of any market and is usually fueled by several factors of varying strengths. For NFTs, we have seen the factors morphing from the erstwhile hype and fear of missing out to problem-solving functionality. This year alone, use cases like GameFi and rentals in an NFT marketplace, music, and tying collectibles to real-world assets have gained more ground. Although early, collectibles are still well-positioned as essential building blocks of the metaverse.\nWhile there is enough evidence that NFTs are not a fad, the current trend points to a future for more utility NFTs. Community-driven projects such as Magic NFTs, web3 art, etc., will not be left behind, as these will come together to form a fruitful NFT environment.\nNFTs you should (probably) read about\nLet’s look at some of the best NFT projects you can look into in priming yourself for the next NFT bull run.\nHave you ever wondered why we have alphanumeric names as wallet addresses? It’s pretty obvious many of us copy from our exchanges and paste them to the appropriate places when trading. What if the process could be more straightforward? Well, ENS solves that.\nENS is a decentralized system that runs on the blockchain and uses smart contracts to make machine identifiers readable in human language. This means that instead of having an address like 0xd8dA6RB10164aF9D7eEd9e03F42315D37aY96045, you can have Ada.eth, and when a user sends Ethereum to said address, the crypto goes in there. Moreover, you can sell your ENS domain name on an NFT marketplace to willing buyers who want the exact name.\nENS is currently amongst the top 20 NFT sales on the leading NFT marketplaces, with over 500,000 unique owners. This trend is not ending soon; you can have your customized address in a few clicks.\nAlthough the collection was created in September, it has quickly grown to be a sensation, even outranking CryptoPunk in weekly trading volume. If you have seen Pepe, the frog, you should get excited about this. The NFT collection has 1,000 unique pieces and has seen popular NFTs present. Unlike ENS, Hedz is focused on art and not on utility. It would be interesting to see this collection in a few months.\nBattle Infinity is a new GameFi project that has caused a lot of hype and attention. The project is split into six different platforms, each with its specific purpose. These purposes include an NFT-based fantasy sports league, player-against-player P2E games, an NFT marketplace, and more. The Battle Infinity ecosystem also consists of an immersive metaverse-based game where players can earn rewards by playing other games within the ecosystem. This makes Battle Infinity a unique and exciting project worth keeping an eye on.\nConclusion\nThe complex ecosystem we call the NFT industry might be down at the moment, but it does not mean you should be on the sideline. Now is an excellent time to get a good investment project as builders are moving forward in full force in preparation for the next phase of the NFT bull run.\nBesides, AirNFTs have now brought everything together in an easy-to-use mobile app for you. You can now trade BSC, FTM, Polygon, Ethereum NFTs on the android app with the iOS version on the way. Be the first to know when the Ethereum chain integration is completed by keeping your eyes on the blog!

    "title": "Ethereum Merge and NFTs",
    "content": "If you have been following crypto news, you must have heard of The Merge– a term that refers to Ethereum’s switch to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol. On September 15, the long-awaited Ethereum merge with the Beacon chain was finalized. Shortly after, Vitalik Buterin, Co-founder of Ethereum, took to his Twitter page to congratulate everyone that made the merge a success and laid out the plan for Ethereum’s road to 100,000 TPS.\nNFT artists were not left behind. Popular NFT artist, Beeple, released an illustration celebrating the successful transition to the proof-of-stake and was joined by several other similar ‘merge arts’.\nThis merge now makes Ethereum the largest proof-of-stake network, a position formerly owned by Cardano.\nThe Rationale for Ethereum Merge\nSeven years after its launch, Ethereum has enough reasons to switch from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake model. Two of the notable issues are energy consumption and scalability.\nWith the rising worldwide call on the dire need to cut energy consumption and embrace renewable energy for climate change, the blockchains operating under the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol have come under fire for their excessive energy usage. Bitcoin and Ethereum are at the forefront of the PoW model, and when combined, they use up more energy than several countries to validate their transactions.\nThe need for special computers to mine blocks requires so much energy and negatively impacts the environment. This is why Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, suspended the acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payment for his company last year.\nEthereum’s scalability trilemma has given rise to several layer-2 blockchains usually touted as “Ethereum Killers.” Ethereum, while servicing the most significant use cases in crypto– Defi and NFTs, could only process between 15-30 transactions per second. The PoW model caused network validators, or miners, to prioritize higher-paying transactions. Hence, any little traffic slows down transactions and shoots up fees. Gas fees have gone as high as 10 ETH per transaction, making the network unfavorable for small-sized investors.\nAlthough it has been explained that The Merge will likely not reduce transaction fees, improving scalability will minimize network congestion and downtimes. Also, reducing energy consumption by 90% is a big win for the ecosystems: the actual planet: fewer emissions and better climate– and the crypto space: one less tool in the detractors’ shed.\nWhat does the Ethereum Merge Means for NFTs?\nAs an NFT investor, the only things that matter are the metrics– demand trading, volumes, transaction fees, etc. The Ethereum merge does little to nothing on the numbers side. However, here are two ground facts: less energy and more upgrades.\nYou must have read think pieces citing NFTs as bad for the planet because of how much energy they consume. This is due, in large part, to its underlying blockchain. With the Ethereum merge, trading NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain comes with 90% less energy, a significant cutdown.\nAlso, the Ethereum Merge is only one step in the development of the network. The subsequent phases for the Ethereum network are The Surge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. Major upgrades we will see include rollups being introduced to the network, the Merkle update, and reducing the hard drive space for validators. Buterin has explained that the Surge rollout will lower the cost of transactions and increase transaction speed.\nAlthough the plan is not all-encompassing, as several new developments will find their way into the network as time progresses, seeing the Ethereum Merge happening according to the plan shines more hope on the feasibility of the subsequent upgrades, and this is some good news.\nThe AirNFTs and Ethereum Merge\nThe Ethereum merge might have been completed, but another “merge” is left— AirNFTs and Ethereum. While Ethereum is on a mission to create the best blockchain for decentralized software, we are also working to develop the most straightforward, cheapest, and biggest multi-chain NFT marketplace for every crypto user.\nEthereum NFTs will be available on the AirNFTs marketplace soon, and you can be the first to know!

    "title": "The ultimate beginner guide to get started with NFTs",
    "content": "In recent years, NFTs have emerged as one of the most critical contemporary innovations in technology, finance, fashion, sports, and the arts. Since their widespread adoption in 2021, NFTs have been the subject of much hype and, more importantly, confusion. However, they have broken into the mainstream, disrupting the art world and the industries beyond it and proving to be one of the best sources of revenue.\nIf you\u0027re new to crypto and digital assets, it can be hard to grasp NFTs and everything that\u0027s going on in this space. But the good news is that we cover the basics you need to get started.\nWhat is an NFT?\nA Non-Fungible Token (or NFT in short) is a digital token uniquely representing an object (physical or otherwise) on the blockchain. NFTs can represent various things: physical objects like artworks, properties, trophies, digital content, or even intangible concepts like intellectual property. For more information, check out what NFTs are and whether they’re here to stay.\nHow are NFTs different from cryptocurrency?\nJust like the money in our bank accounts, you use cryptocurrency for all transactions on the blockchain. Crypto can be purchased or converted into fiat currencies (US dollars, Euros, Yen, etc.) via crypto exchanges.\nUnlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs, on the other hand, are non-fungible. Unlike other money markets where one dollar, for example, can be exchanged for another without disproportionality, NFTs are unique and do not have the same value. Each is unique and cannot be replaced by an identical version because there is no such thing as an identical version.\nThink of NFTs as a birth certificate: it is unique and one of a kind; it is proof that it is you and cannot be replaced by anything else. Just as you can\u0027t exchange your birth certificate with another person\u0027s, NFTs have unique values that can\u0027t be exchanged.\nFor NFTs, their uniqueness and rarity increase their appeal and desirability. And as with all rare items, this rarity allows individuals to sell their NFTs at high prices.\nWhy do people buy NFTs?\nThe main advantage of NFTs is that they confer exclusive ownership on their holders. This means that users can own digital assets unavailable to anyone else, providing them exclusive access to certain benefits, such as entry into exclusive online forums and early access to upcoming NFT collections.\nNFTs are often considered an investment opportunity because of their unique characteristics. Since they cannot be split, each NFT can be worth more than any of the cryptocurrencies it is or was purchased with. This makes them a desirable investment for those looking to make a profit, as their value depends on demand and how much someone is willing to pay for it.\nNFTs are a secure way to verify digital ownership. Each NFT is tracked and verified on a decentralized blockchain, making it virtually impossible to forge or steal. This makes them ideal for safeguarding digital rights, especially in the case of physical assets like real estate.\nWhy are some NFTs more valuable than others?\nThe four factors that make an NFT valuable are:\nFurthermore, an NFT has value because the buyer and their community believe it has value - which is true of all art and collectibles. And over time, an NFT acquires a character of its own, depending on its owner and use factors.\nWhat things can I convert into NFT?\nAnything that can be digitized can be turned into NFT. Did you know? Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet as an NFT for over $2.9 million. In addition to art, music, and media, you can convert collectibles, trading cards, event tickets, in-game items on gaming platforms, virtual clothing, memes, domain names, and other real-world items.\nWhere can I buy NFTs?\nNFTs are bought and sold via NFT marketplaces - such as AirNFTs, Rarible or OpenSea.\nHow to swap crypto to get started with NFTs?\nMost beginners in the crypto and NFT space ask this question. Fortunately, we previously covered two guides to help you learn crypto swapping fundamentals. Check out How to Buy BNB to start minting your NFTs and How to Swap BNB to MATIC for more information.\nHow to create, buy and sell NFTs?\nNew NFTs are created through a process called \"minting\". When choosing a unique asset, remember that you must own the copyright and intellectual property of the item you wish to mint.\nAfter selecting an NFT marketplace and creating an account, you can begin the minting process. This process is slightly different for each marketplace. Still, you\u0027ll generally need to upload the file you intend to associate with your NFT and pay a gas fee to have the transaction processed using BNB, ETH, or another cryptocurrency, depending on the blockchain you use.\nOnce the minting process is complete, you will have all the relevant information about your new NFT, and it will be stored in your crypto wallet. You can keep, sell, or trade it.\nIf you want to create your own NFTs, AirNFTs is a multichain NFT marketplace that lets you mint various NFTs (artworks, music, gaming, photography, etc.) on BNB Chain (former BSC), Fantom (FTM), and Polygon (MATIC) for less than a dollar.\nYou have successfully created your own NFT, what is next?\nYou need to create a buzz around your NFT project so that they stand out and buyers will notice them. Likewise, you can start by advertising your work on social media. Twitter, Instagram, and Discord are the most popular platforms to showcase your creations.\nWhat NFT scams should I be aware of?\nThe NFT market is also vulnerable to scams that can take advantage of unsuspecting users. Want more information on this? See our article on NFTs and rug pulls and how you can keep yourself safe. Also, check this comprehensive guide on how to secure your NFTs.\nConclusion\nDespite their explosion in popularity over the past few years, NFTs are still in their infancy, and it\u0027s never too late to get started. You certainly haven\u0027t missed the boat yet. AirNFTs offers industry-leading benefits such as high NFT transaction speed and low gas fees. AirNFTs also provides more options to users, such as staking with juicy APYs, and allows you to earn BNB, FTM, and Matic on its NFT marketplace.\nOpen our app to start your NFT journey on AirNFTs now!\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "title": "Top 5 NFT Games You Can Start Playing",
    "content": "Earlier this year, we posted a blog piece on the top NFT games in 2022. If you read and acted on the piece, you may have added activity to your pastime jar– making money while playing games. If you didn\u0027t, the next best time is now.\nWhat is a play-to-earn NFT Game?\nPlay-to-earn, or P2E games, reward players with crypto or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They have become trendy in recent years, becoming a central part of almost every metaverse project. Each platform has its form of cryptocurrency to pay online players for their commitment. Earning crypto with real-world value while having fun is one of the main reasons why play-to-earn NFT games have become so popular.\nThere are a wide variety of P2E NFT games. But here\u0027s a look at our top five choices, which you can play and earn with now.\n1. Alien Worlds\nThe game\u0027s plot draws ideas from a 2055 dystopian earth setting, with many prevalent pandemics. A bitcoin mining community discovered that aliens sent messages through cryptic algorithms. And on deciphering, a wormhole was discovered, leading to other habitable planets. The Bitcoin community traveled through the wormhole, gathering a rare stone, Trillium.\nAlien Worlds features six planets in its metaverse, and every asset in the planets is tokenized. The planets feature three kinds of characters: explorers who mine Trillium and earn a part of it as rewards, fighters who contest in arenas for reward, and landowners who rent their lands out to develop the buildings in exchange for money.\n2. Gameta\nGameta is one of the most recent blockchain game platforms, but it has taken the GameFi world by storm. In what can be tagged the Gameta Fever, over 100,000 new users joined the game in one month (July 9 to August 8, 2022), and being on Solana is an added advantage.\nThere are seven games on the Gameta ecosystem - Invest Master, Ants Runner, Super Gloves, Sleep Ragdoll, FrogPrince Rush, Human Tower, and Tadpole Count. Gameta\u0027s games require little to no technical expertise, can be played with any internet-enabled phone, and it is as easy to play as common games like Temple Run.\n3. Splinterlands\nSplinterlands made our list of the blockchain games to look out for in 2022. It is one of the most popular card games that allows users to trade and earn online. Splinterland is easy to understand, rewarding, and short– every game can be completed in a few minutes. There are 500 cards split into four rarity levels; common, epic, rare, and legendary. Each rarity level differs in its circulating supply. Asides from earning from merely playing, you can also trade your cards on third-party marketplaces.\n4. Farmer\u0027s World\nFarmer\u0027s World prides itself as the first blockchain farming game. It functions on the WAX blockchain and mirrors a farmer\u0027s life. The three important items in this blockchain game are food, wood, and gold, identified by their tokens; FWF, FWW, and FWG. The tools needed to get the game\u0027s resources can be crafted or bought, but one caveat is that every tool has a durability period. In addition, Farmer\u0027s World allows users to sell or gift their resources on a decentralized platform, Alcor.\n5. Arc8\nArc8 is a play-to-earn gaming platform launched by GAMEE last September. The Polygon-powered app features a variety of games such as puzzles, sports, adventures, etc., and is available on iOS and Google Play for iPhone and Android users, respectively.\nConclusion\nPlay-to-earn blockchain games, NFT games, call it what you like, sprout every other minute, and keeping up with them is no mere task. So rather than attempting an exhaustive list, we have decided to work with the most popular and rewarding NFT games in vogue.\nWhich of these have you played before? And what was your gaming experience like?\nFollow us on\nBlockchain games like Axie Infinity allow you to buy and sell objects, land, and characters in the game. This works just like blockchains and NFTs, meaning you can profit by minting your character or a series of characters as NFTs.\nIf you want to get started with play-to-earn games, you\u0027ll need a crypto wallet. This will allow you to connect to the game and purchase NFTs. Try popular wallets such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask.\nScammers behind NFT scam games usually plan and execute their schemes on a grand scale. They often target novice investors instead of experts and use attractive websites and advertisements to entice inexperienced users.\nNFT games are generally accessed via PC, but most already provide NFT game platforms that can be accessed using other devices, such as iOS and Android.\nPlay-to-earn and NFT games strive to establish a gaming ecosystem that prioritizes players by granting them ownership of their in-game assets and providing rewards for their engagement in gaming activities.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "AirNFTs is an innovative NFT marketplace built on Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, and Polygon (MATIC), focusing highly on user experience and ease of use to create, buy, sell and trade NFTs.\nAirNFTs offer cutting-edge advantages such as lightning speed, and extremely low fees, in many cases less than $1. Additionally, AirNFTs also allows you to Earn BNB, FTM, and MATIC, as well as an impressive NFT Launchpad where you can raise funds for your project and access their partners and NFT community.\nWhat are the benefits of FIO NFT Signatures for users?\nAdding FIO NFT Signatures is another step forward to improving user experience.\nFIO NFT Signatures protects buyers and sellers of NFTs by giving the creator the ability to sign the NFT using their personalized FIO Crypto Handle.\nA FIO Crypto Handle replaces that long string public address vulnerable to errors and other exploits with a simple, human-readable address. The long string public key address is then replaced with the FIO Crypto Handle in the format of username@domain or, for example, janedoe@Airnfts.\nNFT creators can now use their own personalized FIO Crypto Handle to sign NFTs, which protects buyers and helps sellers by providing a source of authentication that’s easily verifiable on the FIO blockchain.\nFurthermore, AirNFTs is already building on a cross-chain future, which makes this partnership even more critical as FIO is a blockchain agnostic protocol. In other words, FIO NFT Signatures work for NFTs minted on all blockchains.\nAnother great benefit of NFT Signatures is that it helps to protect the permanence of the NFT’s Metadata by storing a hash of it on the FIO blockchain. Many do not realize that most NFTs do not store images, videos, audio, or other properties of the NFT on-chain. Keeping a hash of that data on-chain protects the NFT and its data by creating permanence.\nThis integration enables NFT creators to sign their NFTs during the minting process using their unique, customizable FIO Crypto Handle — a human-readable address (e.g., username@domain) that replaces long-string public wallet addresses.\nNFT creators can also sign their NFTs off-marketplace — even retroactively — using the FIO Dashboard. FIO Crypto Handles are NFTs unto themselves secured by private keys on the FIO blockchain and, by design, cannot be duplicated or forged.\nHere’s an example of how it works: Suppose Leonardo da Vinci was alive today and wanted to release an NFT collection. In that case, he could claim the FIO Crypto Handle leonardo@davinci in the FIO Dashboard (or in any wallet or exchange that has integrated FIO Domains) and use this FIO Crypto Handle to sign his NFTs.\nThrough his social networks, website, newsletter, or NFT marketplace gallery, he could publicize his FIO Crypto Handle to his audience and fans. Letting everyone know that he will sign all his NFTs with his leonardo@davinci FIO Crypto Handle and that any NFT not signed with leonardo@davinici (no matter how genuine it appears) is a fake.\nHow do FIO NFT Signatures work?\nCheck out the video below to learn more about how to sign your own NFTs using the new FIO NFT signatures feature on AirNFTs.\nAbout FIO\nFIO, the Foundation for Interwallet Operability, is a decentralized consortium of blockchain organizations and community members supporting the ongoing development, integration, and promotion of the FIO Protocol. The protocol is an open-source, decentralized usability layer solution that works across all blockchains. It uses human-readable Crypto Handles to replace the complexity, risk, and inconvenience of blockchain-based transactions using public addresses.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "Are you tired of buying multiple NFTs individually on different NFT marketplaces and prefer to make bulk purchases in one place? NFT marketplace aggregators help you do that, and we cover everything you need to know about them in this article. We also explore the benefits of using NFT aggregators and introduce you to the top 3 NFT marketplace aggregators in the market you should know about.\nWhat is an NFT marketplace aggregator?\nHave you visited an e-commerce site comparing a product\u0027s price between multiple online stores? That is an online shopping aggregator. An NFT marketplace aggregator does pretty much the same thing.\nIn simple words, an NFT marketplace aggregator is a platform that allows users to easily trade NFT collections from different NFT marketplaces without having to visit those marketplaces.\nNFT marketplace aggregators combine inventories from multiple NFT marketplaces into one unified interface. This is more convenient for users and gives buyers a clear view of the market, allowing them to compare NFT prices and acquire NFTs from different sources, all in one consolidated purchase.\nWhat are the benefits of using NFT marketplace aggregators?\nNFT aggregators offer several benefits to both NFT buyers and sellers. Let’s look at four of them:\nWhat are the top 3 NFT marketplace aggregators you should try?\nWhile every NFT marketplace aggregator does pretty much the same thing, their features are not always the same, and they don\u0027t all cover the same marketplaces. Let\u0027s take a look at the three popular NFT marketplace aggregators of the moment:\nGenie.xyz was the very first NFT marketplace aggregator to be created. It provides users with a library of NFTs available on several NFT marketplaces and allows them to trade NFTs on most of these marketplaces. Genie covers NFT marketplaces such as Opensea, LooksRare, NFTX, NFT20, and X2Y2. Among its other features, Genie.xyz allows you to save up to 40% on gas fees.\nShopping cart, rarity, flash bot, and whale purchase notification are some of the main features of Gem.xyz. These features keep Gem’s users up to date on the most widespread NFT market trends without being charged any fees, allowing them to have the opportunities to make profits during critical periods. Gem.xyz covers five popular NFT marketplaces, including Opensea, LooksRare, NFTX, and X2Y2. Plus, like Genie.xyz, Gem.xyz helps you save up to 40% on gas fees.\nRareboard is an NFT marketplace aggregator on BNB Chain (former BSC). As the name suggests, it allows you to get up-to-the-second data on the rarity and price of NFT collections listed on its rarity dashboard. Rareboard has integrated 10 of the largest NFT marketplaces on the BNB Chain network: BinanceNFT, NFTKey, PancakeSwap, Galler.io, NFT Trade, etc.\nThe takeaway on NFT Marketplace Aggregators\nAre you looking for a more efficient shopping experience in the NFT space? You should probably start using an NFT marketplace aggregator. Not only do they save you time (because you\u0027re transacting in bulk from different NFT marketplaces in one go), but in most cases, you\u0027re also saving on gas fees (40% on Genie.xyz and Gem.xyz), and that\u0027s pretty good.\nAt AirNFTs, we want to help you learn as much as possible about the upcoming NFT revolution. While our NFT marketplace is not an aggregator, we offer you a more personalized experience and greater exposure to custom-made NFTs than copies. Sounds interesting? Open our marketplace to explore more, and follow our socials today, so you don\u0027t miss our updates.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT marketplace is an online platform that enables users to buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These digital assets can include everything from digital art and music to virtual real estate and in-game items.\nNFT marketplaces operate on a blockchain network, which ensures the security and transparency of transactions. When a user wants to sell an NFT, they create a digital certificate that verifies ownership of the asset and records it on the blockchain. Buyers can then purchase the NFT using cryptocurrency, and the ownership of the digital asset is transferred to the new owner.\nAlmost any type of digital asset can be sold in an NFT marketplace, as long as it is unique and has value. This can include digital art, music, videos, tweets, virtual real estate, in-game items, and more.\nTo buy an NFT, you will need a digital wallet that supports the blockchain network on which the NFT was created. Once you have a digital wallet, you can browse NFT marketplaces and purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nOnce you own an NFT, you can keep it as a digital asset, sell it on a marketplace, or trade it for another NFT. You can also display your NFT in a virtual gallery or showcase it on social media.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "Investment Traits You Should Know About",
    "content": "Like other financial markets, several factors weigh in on an individual when making an NFT investment choice. Behavioral analysts have looked at the impact of the environment, demography, and other socio-economic factors on investors. Their results show a varied trend amongst five significant metrics— risk tolerance, knowledge, level of patience, right decisions, and goal setting.\nInvestors can be categorized into four groups based on their behaviors with the abovementioned approaches. These are the preservers, followers, independents, and accumulators. Let\u0027s examine these four traits under the lens of those metrics so you can identify with and harness your strengths before you start investing.\n1. Preservers\nPreservers are usually established people from different walks of life. Their primary aim is capital preservation, and they typically side with traditional investment vehicles with some guarantee of compounding and capital security. Preservers are very risk averse and care less about astronomical increases in a short period.\n2. Followers\nFollowers are usually moved by market sentiment or hype. They are averse to taking responsibility for their investments and often seek refuge in the decisions of others that are publicly announced. These investors usually prefer flipping, using terms like \"YOLO\" and \"to the moon\" to describe their market perception. Followers are often after quick gains and do not back their desire with a corresponding level of knowledge. The emotional roller coasters with Followers often make them overestimate their rewards and underestimate their risks.\n3. Independents\nThese are very active investors who seek out opportunities as soon as they arise and will often take risks that others wouldn\u0027t due to their high-risk tolerance levels. Independents derive joy and satisfaction from analyzing markets on their own and getting results based on data-backed predictions, although their high-risk tolerance could be bad for their portfolios.\n4. Accumulators\nAccumulators are unique among the three groups because they prize compounding, dollar-cost averaging, and capital preservation as preservers. They\u0027re very knowledgeable about risks but are also cautious, a trait known to Independents. These often zoom out of the news and keep buying, which usually pays off in the long run.\nHow does your investment trait impact your NFT investment path?\nWith hundreds of NFT projects sprouting daily, most buyers find it hard to avoid guesswork when finding NFTs to invest in. This is largely because there are no rule books on assessing valuations other than pointers from past trading experience. Knowing your investment trait and carefully evaluating the metrics will inform your decision of what NFT to invest in– whether you are going for blue-chip tokens tied to physical assets or new collections buzzing on discord groups.\nThe psychology of investing is complex, but it doesn’t have to be mysterious. We hope this article has helped you understand yourself and make better-informed investment decisions.\nSo, what kind of investor are you? Are you the impulsive type who buys on a whim or the more analytical type who does their research before investing?\n‍\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "What are NFT Whitelists and How Do You Get on One?",
    "content": "A whitelist is originally an IT term that connotes an index of entities considered acceptable and trustworthy. Whitelisting is a cybersecurity strategy used to protect computers from potentially harmful applications. Adopting the computing term to the NFT space couldn’t be more ideal, considering the numerous issues faced by project developers that could harm their project. Let’s look at what NFT whitelists are all about.\nWhat are NFT Whitelists?\nWhitelisting in NFT lingo means pre-approving users’ for an NFT project. The pre-approval allows users to mint NFTs in the collection before a public launch. An NFT whitelist is no more than an early access list of the eligible crypto addresses.\nNFT whitelists have become famous for crucial reasons, among which are:\nBefore whitelists came to the fore, NFT traders often got caught up in gas wars, a situation where many traders compete for their transactions to go through first. They do this by offering more gas fees to miners who validate transactions. As a result of the high network traffic, gas fees keep skyrocketing, and those who can’t afford them stand a little to no chance of a successful transaction. Gas wars preclude small-sized traders from many NFT projects. By introducing whitelists, anyone can get early access to mint at reasonable gas fees without fighting for a spot with thousands of competitors.\nNFT whitelisting rewards early and genuine supporters of a project. Entry requirements usually range from being an early member of the group to performing simple tasks such as engagement on social media, inviting members, and creating memes, infographics and fan art.\nNFT whitelists increase the number of unique hodlers in an NFT project by lowering the barrier to entry. This ultimately creates a healthy, balanced project with significant upside potential.\nHow to get an NFT Whitelist spot\nNFT whitelist offers are valid only before launch, and to get on one, you must find projects that have not yet launched. Finding new projects isn’t that difficult as the market keeps booming, and there are now some social media pages and websites that list upcoming projects. A simple Google search will set the ball rolling.\nAfter deciding on a project, look through their social media, mainly their Discord, Twitter and Telegram pages. Check their announcement pages, pinned tweets, roadmaps, etc., and ascertain that they might be worth investing in. Actively participate in community discussions, and create informative content, memes, and fan art.\nFollow the project’s guidelines to apply for the whitelist spot. As said earlier, requirements to clinch a spot broadly vary. For example, some projects may require nothing except filling out a Google form, while others are big on active participation and referrals.\nWhile you are on the grind, looking for the next blue chip to get in on, it is crucial to remember two things:\nThe bottom line on NFT Whitelists\nAs the NFT market keeps snowballing, more investment strategies come to the fore with the potential to reduce pain points and enrich timely investors. While getting an NFT whitelist spot does not guarantee a profit, it does increase the chances of a project’s success.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "NFT Buying Strategy: Presales vs. Public Mints",
    "content": "Like in any financial market, timing is a core factor determining profitability – the common goal of any lay investor. Knowing when and how to buy NFTs is even more critical since their non-fungibility makes selling off tricky. This brief article compares the two common ways users get in on new NFT projects – presales and public mints.\nWhat are NFT Presales?\nNFT presale is a sales strategy offered by project developers to allow investors to acquire units of their collection before launching. Token presales are often distributed to crypto influencers, celebrities, and other users through whitelists. Whitelists are early access lists of wallets pre-approved by developers for minting. Whitelisting an NFT project is a way to appreciate the early and genuine believers in an NFT project.\nPros and Cons of NFT Presales\nGetting whitelisted is the nirvana feeling every NFT trader wants, as it has its upsides. First, users can buy NFTs at the lowest price possible and access some of the rarest ones with unique traits. Also, whitelists create a significant buzz around projects, driving demand and value up in the process. Hence, whitelisted users often get to sell their NFTs at a higher price when the project eventually launches or subsequently. Other community benefits available to presale token holders include discounted fees on future collections and exclusive access to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) for participation in governance, fund usage, etc. While the whitelist offers a cheaper way to get in on a project, the downside is that the project might not take off, as there are no guarantees in crypto. For instance, whitelisted users that minted Pixelmon NFTs for 3 ETH can only sell their assets at a floor price of 0.2 ETH at the time of writing.\nAlso, the desperation to get into whitelists often make unsuspecting users vulnerable to wallet hacks, phishing attacks, and rug pulls.\nWhat are Public Mints?\nPublic mints work the same way with presales, only that buying starts at launch. After the presale ends, the developers will announce a time for the public sales of the tokens. Although it is still possible to mint items with uncommon traits, the likelihood largely depends on the quantity that is left and how well you fare in gas wars.\nPros and Cons of Public Mints\nBuying an NFT from a public market will give you the privilege of seeing the demand and analytical records for the project. While this does not always prevent buying an illiquid project, it helps filter low-prospect projects based on demand. On the flip side, NFT collections with high activity at launch are often deemed successful, increasing gas fees. To outbid other users and ensure their transaction goes through, collectors often increase gas fees, a term known as \"gas war.\" You should note that even if your transaction fails, you\u0027ll still get to pay gas fees, and there are no refunds. Whitelisted individuals can avoid the enormous minting gas fees by participating in presales.\nAnd, of course, the market can be sometimes unforgiving, with a minimal guarantee on sustained demand.\nAre NFT Presales Better Than Public Mints?\nThere is no better or worse approach to buying an NFT; at the end of the day, your choice should primarily come from due diligence. You must do detailed research into any project you intend to put your money into, not just FOMO because of hype.\nFortunately, purchasing NFTs during public mints has been made seamless with us.

    "content": "As you may (or may not) already know, NFT projects are growing in number and popularity. Every day, every week or every month there are new developments on various NFT marketplaces. As a result, it can be extremely difficult (not to mention overwhelming) to find an NFT that makes you money, especially if you’re a beginner in the NFT space. In this guide, we explore some of the things you need to consider in this process.\nHow to find NFTs that make you money?\nNFT projects can mean different things to different people, and understanding why you buy them is a good place to start. Only then can you find NFTs that will generate income for you. There are many categories on NFT marketplaces including art NFTs, music NFTs, gaming NFTs, virtual lands, to name a few. Do you want to make money flipping NFTs? Are you buying just because you love the art (artistic value)? Having an answer to these questions will help you refine your search.\nOne of the best places to start learning about a project is the official website, as this is where you can learn about the NFT project\u0027s roadmap and get a full picture of past accomplishments as well as the vision for the future. You can also check out the project\u0027s social media. In the NFT space, Twitter is a great place to start.\nThe easiest way to get an idea of the community behind an NFT project in which you want to find NFTs that will make you money is to join its communication channels, such as its Telegram or Discord server. There you can meet other NFT collectors, ask questions to the moderators and get appropriate help.\nYou\u0027ll need to research the artist or the seller by checking things like their social media handle, trading volume, and verification badge, among others. You can also support new artists, but this requires thorough research, so you don\u0027t fall for scams or rug pulls. Always check the NFT properties as a backup if you want to buy from an unverified account.\nWant to determine if an NFT is worth buying? Then you must first check the rarity of the properties it has. When you are on an NFT marketplace, you can see the attributes that determine the rarity of the NFT, but it is important to reverse check the art using Google Images to avoid buying something that has been plagiarized. See our previous article to learn more about how to validate the authenticity of an NFT.\nIf you want to confirm that the NFT you have chosen is a good investment and will bring in more money, it is always a good idea to check the seller\u0027s account. There you can view their previous sales and find out the selling price of their NFTs. You can also check the sale price of the same NFTs a few weeks or months ago. The lower end of the range is called the floor price, which is the minimum price at which NFTs are trading for. This will give you a good idea of how NFT prices are fluctuating and whether this is what you would like to see in the NFT of your choice in the future.\nClosing thoughts on the Six Brilliant ways to find NFTs that make you money\nThere are a lot of things to check before you buy an NFT, but hopefully this guide has given you some knowledge about some of the things to consider when looking for NFTs that will make you money.\nOpen our app to start your NFT journey now!\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "content": "The hype around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continues to grow as one of the legitimate revenue streams in the blockchain industry. To stay up to date on daily or monthly trends, including those related to new NFT projects or NFT drops, NFT investors are always looking for the best tools to use. NFT calendars appear to be one of them. But what does an NFT calendar mean, and why is it important? Let’s find out!\nWhat is an NFT calendar\nNFT calendars are online platforms designed to help users create and share NFT-related updates or events to stay on top of the latest NFT drops. They typically feature an overview of NFT projects and a list of all participating projects and their native tokens. NFT calendars also include the dates and times of NFT drops, as well as a countdown to the start of each drop.\nWhy you should use an NFT calendar\nGenerally, it’s possible to track NFT projects on NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs or OpenSea. But these are only designed to function as marketplaces - where you can buy and sell NFTs, not necessarily where you can get valuable information about an NFT project or upcoming NFT drops or events.\nAs an NFT investor, it is extremely important to be aware of the most significant NFT drops expected in the near future. This way, you are ready to buy the most popular NFTs before they sell out.\nHere are the top three reasons why you should start using an NFT calendar:\nAn NFT calendar is mainly used as a resource to find NFT drops early enough, so you can invest in them or flip NFTs for more money.\nChoosing the right NFT calendar\nTo know which NFT calendar is right for you, there are a few things to consider:\nWhat are the best NFT calendars where you can promote your own NFT drops?\nThe takeaway on what is an NFT calendar and why you need to use it\nAn NFT calendar is important because it allows you to never miss your favorite project\u0027s NFT drops. It also allows you to be the first to know when a new project is launched. This can save you a lot of time and money, as you won\u0027t have to spend hours looking for information about upcoming NFT releases.

    "content": "In 2022 so far, spending on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continues to skyrocket, with over $37 billion already sent to NFT marketplaces. Activity in the NFT space is stabilizing and spending is expected to reach record levels by the end of the year.\nThere are many people who are making a lot of money with NFTs, and there are still many others who want to get in on the action but don\u0027t know how to start yet. If you are one of them, this article will help you learn the most profitable ways to make money with NFTs quickly as a beginner.\nIf this is the first time you\u0027ve heard of NFTs, check out our previous article on what NFTs are and if they\u0027re here to stay to get an idea of the concept.\nHow to make money with NFTs for beginners?\nDue to speculation and rarity, NFTs have the potential to increase in value, but it is best to get into promising NFT projects early enough before their value increases. As a result, the resale value can be much greater than the initial purchase.\nMost of the top NFTs (like the Cryptopunks) to buy currently on various NFT marketplaces could initially be bought very cheaply between $1 and $34, but when the hype around NFTs increased in 2021, they became incredibly valuable due to their leading edge in the NFT space.\nGenerally speaking, flipping is buying low and selling high, aiming for higher returns. The best way to flip NFTs is to buy all available NFTs when they are cheap (NFT projects with a limited quantity of items are more likely to bring you profits). If you buy all the NFTs available when they are cheap, you can resell them for a lot of money. To learn more, see how to flip NFTs for profit.\nYes, you can also make money with NFTs by minting them yourself. Minting an NFT, in simple terms, refers to the process of publishing your digital asset (such as digital art, photography, game items, videos or music) on the blockchain to make it purchasable. Minting NFTs is a relatively simple process, with leading NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or AirNFTs making the process even easier for beginners to monetize their work. To succeed, your digital asset must be unique and original.\nPlaying NFT games to make money has become a popular approach, with many interesting platforms such as Splinterlands or Axie Infinity offering a way to generate regular income for experienced players.\nMany of the best NFT games now use play to earn features, allowing skilled game players to generate revenue. These rewards are usually in the form of platform-native tokens, which means they can be spent on in-game items or exchanged for FIAT currency on decentralized exchanges (DEX).\nHow to invest in NFTs\nIf you are looking to invest in new NFT projects for flipping or if you simply want to buy and sell NFTs, a safe and reliable NFT marketplace can make your job easier.\n‍AirNFTs makes it easy for everyone to get started with NFTs. You can monetize your creative works for less than a dollar on Smart Chain, Fantom as well as Polygon. In addition, minting is extremely easy, and you can choose from a wide range of categories including NFT art, video NFT, NFT music, etc. Moreover, as a non-custodial NFT marketplace, the platform leaves you in full control of your NFTs.\n‍Closing thoughts on the best ways how to make money with NFTs for beginners\nNFTs continue to be a major trend that everyone seems to be raving about right now, and there are more NFT use cases yet to be fully explored.

    "title": "What is DeFi Staking in Web3 and why does it matter",
    "content": "What is DeFi Staking?\nThe term DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. Unlike centralized finance (CeFi), our current monetary system (where money is held by banks or corporations), DeFi allows anyone with access to the internet to lend, borrow and bank without an intermediary (such as a bank), using smart contracts on a blockchain.\nIn its simplest form, DeFi staking involves locking your crypto-assets such as crypto-tokens or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into a smart contract for a set period of time (sometimes a month), with the goal of earning more of those tokens in return, usually in the form of juicy APYs (Annual Percentage Yield) on DeFi platforms. Think of it as the decentralized equivalent of putting your money in a fixed bank account.\nHow does DeFi Staking work?\nTo earn rewards with DeFi staking, users have to deposit eligible (native) tokens or coins into a DeFi protocol such as PancakeSwap or ColonyLab. Then, the staked tokens are used to verify transactions on the blockchain (using the Proof-of-Stake mechanism). They act as guarantees and ensure that a block of transactions is error-free. The interest you earn on your tokens is the reward for lending your tokens to the network or DeFi protocol to verify transactions.\nIn addition to the minimum deposit requirements of some blockchain networks, some platforms such as AirNFTs also impose a minimum 30-day lock-in period during which you cannot withdraw your tokens, or suffer a 10% penalty if you do so before. By the way, you can get higher interest rates in exchange for putting your coins into play for a longer period of time.\nDeFi staking makes you earn interest on the cryptocurrency you already own. It makes your crypto work for you, generating regular income without you having to sell your tokens.\n‍What are the benefits of Staking?\nThe main advantages of DeFi staking are that it allows users to earn more crypto, and the interest rates can be extremely generous.\nWhat are the risks of staking crypto?\nLike most things in crypto, DeFi staking also carries its own risks. When you stake your coins or tokens, you give up ownership of them. If your staking platform is hacked or your coins or tokens are lost, you may not be able to get them back. Some staking platforms have insurance policies to protect users against these types of losses, but there are no guarantees.\n‍What are the different types of DeFi Staking?\nStaking involves locking digital assets into a smart contract on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. These assets are then used to validate transactions and secure the blockchain protocol, allowing you to be rewarded with passive staking profits.‍\nLiquidity mining involves moving crypto assets and tokens to a DeFi network to form liquidity pools. These pools are then used by Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) to enable decentralized trading, known as Automated Market Making (AMM).\nSuch a pool usually consists of two tokens that in turn form a pair of cryptocurrencies. Global trading on DEX exchanges relies on the availability of liquidity providers and pools that facilitate trading activities.\nYield farming is a very popular type of DeFi staking where different investors move tokens to a DeFi platform to form a staking pool. The idea is to make their assets available to a lending protocol or liquidity pool, and they earn passive income in the form of interest as well as a percentage of the revenue generated by the platform of their choice. They can also easily redirect their assets to other pools and platforms to maximize their income.\nThe takeaway on what is DeFi Staking in Web3 and why it matters\nDeFi staking has shown, by far, that it has great potential to provide a viable alternative to traditional investing.\nAre you interested in staking today?

    "title": "NFT Lending Explained",
    "content": "What is NFT Lending?\nNFT lending refers to a process in which borrowers pledge NFT assets to obtain a loan, usually funded by another person or lender, who is also seeking returns on their investment. If you want to make money with NFTs without selling the ones you own, NFT lending can help you get higher returns than regular cryptocurrency loans or traditional peer-to-peer (P2P) loans.\nHow does it work?\nLike the classic DeFi lending platforms, NFT lending allows users to collateralize their NFTs to obtain loans in fiat or cryptocurrency for a specified duration.\nNFTfi, for example, is an NFT lending platform that matches interested borrowers and lenders. Lenders offer loans in cryptocurrency to other users on their NFTs, while borrowers provide the NFTs as collateral. Using smart contracts, the platform matches users and allows them to negotiate the terms of the loans. Lenders get to determine the fair value of the NFT by checking through an asset’s past performance or by comparing the asset price with the floor price of closely-related NFTs.\nOnce the loan terms are agreed on, the NFT is moved into a digital vault while the crypto loan is released for use. Borrowers can unlock their NFT if the loan is repaid within the specified duration; otherwise, the lender can claim the NFT. Loan values are typically about 50% of the current market value of the NFT, and the course can range from weeks to months.\nThe protocol supports over 150 NFT collections, especially the blue chips such as BAYC, CryptoPunks, Mutant Apes, etc.\nNFT Lending: Upsides\nNFT Lending: The Risks\nAlthough, in theory, the concept of NFT loans looks foolproof, the reality is far from that. First, for borrowers, defaulting on loans means selling your NFT at a low price. Loan to value ratios can be as low as 30-50%. Also, the non-fungible nature of NFTs means borrowers cannot support their position in case of a margin call. And, of course, NFT lending markets are not spared from the risks laden in DeFi— hacks, thefts, and even rug pulls.\nNFT Lending: Bottom line\nBy leveraging DeFi, lending markets expand possibilities in NFT markets. NFT lending, with other DeFi services such as staking and renting, might eventually make the NFTs evolve into assets used for more lucrative financial services.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness.

This piece will show you how to spot NFT rug pulls and avoid falling victim to one.\nWhat are NFT Rug pulls, and How Do They Occur?\nIn its most simplistic form, a rug pull connotes a business exit scam where the founders or lead developers of a project part with investors’ funds after fundraising. These founders often come with enticing plans but neither execute the projects nor help investors get returns on their capital. Rug pulls are not novel scams in crypto, a recent one being the squidgame token rug pull that left millions of users in despair after the founders cleaned out up to $3 million of users’ funds.\nFor NFTs, there are numerous ways in which rug pulls can occur. First, these projects might offer presales of their NFTs, with grandiose promises on how they are the next best thing and fixed release date. Then, after minting the tokens, common sequel include:\nWarning Signs of NFT Rug Pulls\nNFT rug pulls often come with early red flags such as the following:\nNFTs and Rug Pulls - How to Stay Safe: Bottom line\nAvoiding NFT rug pulls ultimately comes down to doing due diligence and noting early warning signs.

    "content": "In 2021, the NFT marketplace declared a total market value of over $40 billion, with celebrity endorsements from the likes of Snoop Dog, Mark Cuban and many others. Whether they support non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or not, investors from different sectors cannot ignore this new trend. However, despite the rapid growth of NFTs, there are still many criticisms and questions about their legitimacy. This guide will provide you with an in-depth understanding of the value of NFTs, to help you answer those who think NFTs are scams.\n‍Why people think NFTs are scams?\nSince their inception, a number of people have viewed NFTs as an old-fashioned scam in a high-tech guise. They see them as overpriced JPEG files, a terrible idea and full of problems.\nHere are some reasons:\nAt AirNFTs, we believe that instead of calling all NFT projects scams, people should broaden their understanding and elaborate more on the diversity and future use cases offered by NFTs.\nNFT are everywhere, beyond digital artworks, and there is tremendous untapped potential in the NFT market. We talked more about the Future of NFTs in a previous article but here are some interesting examples:\nBefore generalizing all NFTs as scams, it is best to make a clear distinction between the concept itself (what an NFT is) and the malicious actors who create these scams.\nHow do NFT scams work?\nNFT scams work by either stealing your crypto wallet\u0027s login credentials or by tricking you into believing that you have successfully bought or sold a legitimate NFT. Many cybercriminals are attracted by the monetary value attached to these digital assets, so they adapt their usual hacking methods, such as phishing, to break into cryptocurrency users\u0027 accounts and steal NFTs. We\u0027ll discuss this in more detail below.\nHow to recognize an NFT scam?\nThey fall into several categories, let\u0027s look at some of them:\nIt is literally a scam run by illegitimate NFT creators. In simple terms, a Rug Pull is when a scammer lures you into what appears to be a legitimate NFT project. Right after its launch, the developers suddenly leave and disappear. Unfortunately, they get away with all your funds. Although you still have the token, coin or NFT, at this point it is already worthless.\nOnly buy NFTs from trustworthy NFT marketplaces, such as AirNFTs, or OpenSea, where the artists are verified and where there are complaint and refund procedures.\nScammers simply sell digital images, without actually minting NFTs. These projects are often accompanied by social media campaigns, promises of incredible value and very little knowledge about the NFT creator. As the money comes in, the scammers wait for their exit. Buyers receive something, usually a JPEG attached to an email, and the scammers disappear with their money and email address. Because NFT verification is not simple for uninitiated buyers, this scam can be devastating to a wide audience.\nIf you are buying an NFT, as always, do your research. Check the seller\u0027s account verification. On AirNFTs, this is a blue verification badge. Follow the seller on social media and also check their history on NFT marketplaces. Also look for complaints. If the artwork was stolen, you\u0027ll likely find traces of the real owners online.\nPhishing scams are nothing new, but in the complex world of NFTs and crypto, it can be easy to fall for them if you are new to the technology. New NFT offerings come out in rapid succession, and it\u0027s easy to get caught up in the hype. Scammers will often ask you for your security details or wallet address. Never give out information willingly and never give out your 12-word seed phrase - and keep it offline, ideally on a USB stick.\nTo stay safe, only share your wallet details with sites you trust, and never give out details if asked. Only give out details when you visit a site yourself, without being linked to it by an email or Twitter post.\nHow to avoid NFT scams?\nDue diligence is required. We discussed this in more detail in our previous article on \"How to validate the authenticity of an NFT\". Here are some of the things users should consider:\nShould you invest in NFTs?\nNot all NFTs are scams, but you should know that most of them have no inherent value or utility behind them. Some do, especially in crypto-games, but most NFTs are mere collectibles that can\u0027t earn you passive income if they aren\u0027t traded. As an investor, you need to understand the value of the underlying asset that NFT represents before you buy.\nClosing thoughts\nWhen you buy and sell NFTs, you don\u0027t have many safeguards to protect you from scams, price gouging, etc. People often get scammed by buying or selling illegitimate NFTs from an entity that claims to be a verified NFT project. You should trade NFTs on secure NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs and always do your own research before throwing money in an NFT project.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "content": "NFTs have grown popular over the years, but unfortunately, so are malicious actors. Up to $2M worth of NFTs have been lost in hacks, thefts and other schemes this year alone. This piece will educate you on how marketplaces and wallets work and keep your NFTs secure while purchasing and or in storage.\nHow NFT Marketplaces Work\nHaving severally explained what an NFT is, there is no doubt that everyone now knows how it works and its future prospects.\nLike other digital assets, NFTs are bought and sold in marketplaces, ranging from popular non-custodial platforms like Opensea and AirNFTs to custodial ones like Binance and Coinbase. Here\u0027s a brief overview of how each of them works:\nNon-custodial marketplaces, as you probably already know, require you to access the platform via a web3-compatible wallet like Trust Wallet or Metamask. Buying one will require you to connect the blockchain network\u0027s wallet to your NFT account. For example, to buy an NFT on Ethereum-based marketplaces like Opensea or rarible, you must connect an Ethereum wallet.\nOn the other hand, custodial marketplaces require you to trade only after verifying their details and complete in KYC. After buying, your NFT, like other coins, will be stored in a section usually known as “Assets” or “Wallets.”\nSecuring Your NFTs: Buying and Selling\nTrading NFTs in either type of marketplace bears several risks and benefits that must be considered carefully. Custodial marketplaces often require identity verifications and are well subject to regulations. This means your assets could be clamped down upon suspicion of nefarious activities (even if there are none). Non-custodial marketplaces, on the other hand, favour autonomy but, at the expense provide easy access to bad actors that can easily scam unsuspecting users, parting away with their funds.\nRegardless of the category you choose to stay in, here are measures to stay safe while purchasing your NFTs:\nThere are now several phoney platforms created with near-similar URLs used to deceive unsuspecting buyers. For example, hackers may create a website with the URL \"www.airNFT/.com\" instead of \"www.airnfts.com\". To avoid falling victim to this, remember the following:\nPurchasing fake NFTs is one of the ways users often fall into scams. Fake NFTs are often plagiarized, watered-down versions or artworks littered on several pages. Thankfully, you can easily validate the authenticity of any NFT you are buying on AirNFTs.\nTransactions on a blockchain are traceable, and doxing your wallet address at every chance you get will do no good. You could be monitored by hackers waiting for a vulnerable moment, or even physically attacked in extreme cases. Instead, you can create multiple wallets for several uses and keep a low profile as much as possible.\nIt would help if you considered protecting your device with top antiviruses against hidden malware or spyware that can secretly record your transactions.\n‍How NFT Wallets Work\nAfter you have purchased your NFT, it gets stored in a wallet. Wallets work similarly to traditional bank accounts in that the software stores your tokenized assets using two keys—public and private. Public keys can be thought of as bank account numbers with which you receive funds (NFTs), while private keys are unique passwords used to sign off transactions. Like NFT marketplaces, several factors also differentiate wallets, and the most important is the custody of private keys.\nCustodial wallets keep the keys and instead provide users with personal credentials to sign up/ log in to their platforms.\nNon-custodial wallets, on the other hand, encrypt your wallet\u0027s private keys to generate a 12--24-word string of random words called recovery phrase or seed phrase. Non-custodial wallets afford users autonomy, i.e., you open a web3 wallet, sign in to the platform and connect, buy your NFT, and your piece will be saved on your wallet, which you can disconnect from the marketplace at any time.\nSecuring Your NFTs: Wallet Safety\nLet’s look at several ways to keep your custodial and non-custodial wallets secure.\nFor custodial wallets, keeping your wallet safe rests in large parts on your wallet provider; but you will still need to be careful with your password.\nFor non-custodial wallets, you bear the sole responsibility of keeping your NFTs safe, and this is hinged on how well you secure your recovery phrase. Losses often result from improper storage or inadvertent leaks via phishing, fake airdrops, impersonations etc. Here are the essential measures to keep your recovery phrase safe:\nThe best way to store your recovery phrase is to write down each word in the correct order on paper and keep it in two or three secure places. Although some use their phone\u0027s notes app to save, it\u0027s best to avoid any digital footprint. If you are worried about the durability of paper, you can get a cheap crypto tag from an e-commerce shop.\nAfter storing your recovery phrase, the next step is effortless—keep it there! Unless you want to access your wallet app on another device, there is absolutely no reason to reveal your recovery phrase to anyone— not even the wallet provider. There are popular ways users leak their recovery phrases, such as phishing attacks, impersonation, fake airdrops, etc.\nPhishing attacks can come in pop-ups on websites or fake accounts on social media requiring you to write down your recovery phrase to win some reward. The targets are often newbies and users yearning for quick gain.\nHere\u0027s what phishing looks like:\nTo avoid falling into such a scam, remember the following:\n‍The Takeaway\nSecuring your NFTs is of utmost importance; hence, you must always cover loose ends and update yourself on the best practices.

    "content": "Are you new to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or perhaps an artist, collector, or enthusiast seeking to connect with others who share your passion? If so, you should join an NFT community or create one. These communities provide valuable opportunities for NFT creators to learn, engage with fellow enthusiasts, and exchange ideas. The immense global recognition achieved by popular NFT projects such as Cryptopunks, Axie Infinity, and Bored Ape Yacht Club can be attributed, in part, to the strong communities they have formed around them.\nIn this guide, you\u0027ll discover the secrets to building a thriving NFT community to unlock the potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You\u0027ll learn how to leverage NFT communities to enhance your brand, connect with like-minded individuals, and establish a strong presence in the NFT and crypto space.\nWhat is an NFT community?\nAn NFT community is an online collective of individuals who share a mutual interest in a particular set of NFT projects. These communities typically convene on platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, or Discord to discuss the NFT project they are passionate about.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Creating an NFT Community?\nCreating an NFT community serves as a catalyst for communication and knowledge sharing within the NFT space. It provides a platform for discussing emerging projects, exchanging ideas and resources, and fostering relationships, enabling NFT enthusiasts to tap into the community\u0027s collective wisdom.\nGiven the ever-evolving nature of the NFT space, staying updated is crucial, and a community can play a vital role in this regard. Furthermore, it serves as an educational hub for newcomers, instills trust, fosters unity, and makes investing in NFTs a more comfortable experience.\nEstablishing an NFT community presents an excellent opportunity to unite individuals who share a deep passion for the industry and drive innovation. With the support of a robust and vibrant community, the potential for growth and exploration becomes limitless.\n‍6 Powerful Tips to Build an NFT Community the Right Way\nMaster the art of building a thriving NFT community with these essential tips:\nBefore creating your community, defining your target audience and identifying your collection\u0027s unique selling point or niche is crucial. Different audiences will necessitate distinct approaches when it comes to community-building endeavors.\nJust as promoting luxury sports cars at a gathering of environmental activists may not be the most effective approach, promoting your community in a forum where people have little interest or understanding of NFTs is likely to fail. You will be better equipped to establish and maintain meaningful connections by thoroughly understanding your primary audience.\nTo build an exceptional NFT community:\nIt\u0027s not just about art and NFTs but about creating a sense of belonging and shared values. Forge an emotional connection and foster an engaged community that contributes to growth and success.\nDevelop strategies to build awareness, fostering organic growth for your NFT community through post sharing, word of mouth, airdrops, mystery boxes, and more. Remember that simply increasing the member count or followers isn\u0027t sufficient.\nSustaining the hype requires finding effective strategies to maintain momentum. One such approach is partnering with companies and other creators in the industry. This could propel your project\u0027s status and its community higher. Like any industry, networking is essential, especially to get your name out there.\nMaintain a strong and consistent online presence to promote a sense of belonging. For example, don\u0027t forget to hold \"Ask Me Anything\" (AMA) sessions to engage with your audience. This will give your NFT project a voice, as the audience will believe that an authentic person or team runs the project.\nDeliver on your promises to build trust and loyalty within your community. Stay true to your vision and mission, and communicate any changes transparently to your audience.\nConsidering what value people will derive from purchasing your NFTs is crucial. Offering real-life utilities with your NFTs will significantly attract interest in your project. Take the Bored Ape Yacht Club as an example: despite its current floor price of 46.78047 ETH, its popularity continues to grow due to the allure of high net-worth social connections and the ownership rights to intellectual property (IP).\nLooking to get started with NFTs?

    "content": "If you\u0027re a cryptocurrency investor, staking is a concept you\u0027ll hear about often, but like many crypto concepts, staking can be a complicated or simple idea, depending on how many levels of understanding you\u0027re willing to unlock. This guide will cover the basics of staking and how it works as it does, and how you can start earning crypto.\n‍What is Staking?\nStaking is part of the process that some cryptocurrencies use to verify transactions. To explain it well, it’s important to have some basic understanding of blockchain transactions. Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) are two consensus mechanisms used to validate transactions on a blockchain platform.\n‍Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work\nBitcoin, the first blockchain ever created, uses Proof of Work. This consensus, often referred to as \"mining,\" uses hardware to provide node validation and generate new blocks on the blockchain. Because computers must perform these complicated calculations, they tend to cost more, due to the high power consumption. Therefore, mining is not a sustainable system, and not everyone can be a miner on the network.\nProof of Stake, on the other hand, is an alternative to PoW. Instead of mining, and much less energy-intensive, validators stake their crypto using complex algorithms to generate new blocks. Platforms such as AirNFTs prefer staking to mining, as it is much more environmentally friendly. Proof of stake is one of the most popular for its efficiency and because participants can earn rewards on the crypto they stake.\nStaking rewards are an incentive that blockchains offer to participants. Each blockchain has a set amount of crypto rewards for validating a block of transactions. Each time you stake and are chosen to validate transactions, you receive crypto rewards.\n‍What are the benefits of staking crypto?\nThere are all sorts of benefits to staking cryptocurrencies, let\u0027s look at three:\n‍Risks related to staking crypto\nThe biggest risk you face with staking is that the price will drop. Keep this in mind if you find crypto offering extremely high staking reward rates.\nAlthough the cryptos you put into play still belong to you, you have to unlock them before you can trade them again. It is important to know if there is a minimum lock-in period and how long the unlocking, so you won\u0027t have any unpleasant surprises.\n‍How to earn crypto with juicy APY\nYou can earn crypto with high APY by saving, staking, or taking advantage of promotional offers.\nThe Annual Percentage Yield (APY) acts as a cryptocurrency savings account similar to an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) account. You can deposit your bitcoin (or other crypto asset) and receive a fixed rate of return over a specific period of time. In other words, APY is a method of calculating the amount of money earned on a money market account over the course of a year. It is a technique for tracking the accumulation of interest over time.\nThe interest you earn on your funds is called compound interest. This is the amount you receive on both the principal amount (the money you put in your account) and the interest that has been earned. Compounding creates money over time, which is why it is such a powerful investment tool.\n‍How to Stake AIRT with juicy APY?\nNote: The lock-up period for staking on AirNFTs is one month (30 days). If you wish to claim your rewards before this time, you will be charged a 10% penalty.\nConclusion\nAirNFTs has entered the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space to offer more options to its users on its NFT marketplace. This will empower more NFT projects to access customized staking services without having to build their own smart contracts, and also earn passive income on BSC via AirNFTs.\nStart Earning Now!\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

If it\u0027s the former, find something worth minting NFTs on, or better yet, find an interesting and potential use case. Some of the most popular NFTs use cases include digital art, gaming, fashion, and music. There is value and opportunity to be found in all of these use cases.\nOnce you have a valuable digital asset to sell, it\u0027s time to create your NFTs. Start by choosing one of the many NFT marketplaces available, such as AirNFTs, where you can mint your NFTs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Fantom (FTM) or Polygon (MATIC) for less than a dollar.\nIf you\u0027re into digital art, NFTs are a great way to invest in unique artwork. Look for artists who have defined a certain style and trajectory. If the artist is committed to his or her work and has an ongoing artistic NFT project, the work you buy is more likely to increase in value later on. Similarly, if you are an NFT collector of a certain style, you may decide to ignore the price at some point. In short, choose something you like and are willing to keep for a long time.\nThese can come in many forms. It can be a collection of similar NFT artworks or an NFT game that grows with new creations. Every time a utility NFT project is sold on a secondary NFT marketplace, royalties could be distributed in the form of special coins to all NFT holders of that utility. Be sure to research the NFT artist or NFT marketplace, creating an NFT art. If it turns out that they have a strong track record of creating unique and valuable NFT works, have a history of continuing to create NFTs in the future, and have an engaged fan base on social media, it is more likely to be worth the investment.\nSince NFT markets can go down or up at any time, if the value of the NFTs you bought goes up after you buy them, you may be able to sell them for a profit. Check our previous article to get more insights on How to Flip an NFT for Profit.\n‍How to pick NFTs that make you money?‍\nThere are a number of projects that offer users the opportunity to purchase NFTs, but not all of them are worth it. In fact, the vast majority of them are not good investments. In many cases, most NFT projects follow a path where the launch is heavily hyped and most users rush to buy NFTs. Then the hype fades, prices drop, and trading volumes are much lower for a period of time. After a while, some projects will sustain themselves through game development and community building, while most will quietly disappear.\nA good starting point is to look at which NFT projects have the highest trading volume using NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, Opensea or Rarible. This gives you a good idea of the hottest and trendiest projects worth looking at, but be aware that volume can drop off very quickly when the hype dies down.\nOnce you have an NFT project to evaluate, one factor to check is the evolution of the activity over time. Are the number of users and transaction volume increasing or decreasing? If you are considering a short-term transaction, you should only look at projects that are increasing.\nIt is also important to get a sense of how active and engaged the project\u0027s community members are. Follow the project\u0027s Twitter handle, join the Discord as well as Telegram channels for more information. Are there many people discussing the project? Are they playing (and enjoying) the game, or are they sitting on the sidelines? These are subjective and relative factors, so it will be easier to assess them after reviewing various NFT projects.\nIs this a new project, or one that has existed for some time? If a project is new and there is not yet a game or other mechanism to give NFTs a utility, it will be much harder for it to maintain a community. Buying NFTs at a pre-sale or earlier in general is much riskier than buying a project that has already built something and gathered a dedicated community.\n‍What to check before buying NFTs?\nNFT collections consist of individual avatar NFT artworks, which are all unique in their own way. Sometimes the greater the uniqueness, the higher the value, but sometimes this is not the case. Sometimes the simplest avatars have more value, like the basic Bored Ape NFT.\nChecking the uniqueness of an NFT is also a great way to confirm that it is legitimate. Many scammer accounts upload copies of popular NFTs, but cannot replicate their properties.\nIf you want to increase your chances of buying an NFT with a promising value trajectory, check the rarity of the properties of your chosen NFT.\nOfficial sellers on NFT marketplaces like AirNFTs will have a blue verification check mark next to their account name to prove that they are trustworthy and not scam accounts. So, if you are looking to buy from a known seller, such as rizkiahmads or yobaninja, make sure the account has a verification checkmark.\nHowever, this verification check mark cannot always be used to verify the legitimacy of the seller. Many legitimate NFT sellers do not yet have their verification check mark on certain NFT marketplaces, just like some influencers on social media who are not yet verified. So check the NFT properties as a backup if you want to buy from an unverified account.\nWhen you swap cryptocurrencies, buy an NFT or perform a similar action on an NFT marketplace, you often have to pay a transaction/gas fee, but these may vary depending on the platform. Some platforms charge fees on both sides of the transaction. As an NFT collector, it is best to know the existing fees on the NFT marketplace of your choice before making any purchases.\nNFTs do not have the same liquidity as cryptocurrencies, which is extremely important to keep in mind. It is very difficult to liquidate an NFT in traditional currency, compared to how you can with cryptocurrency. This can be an obstacle for those who invest in NFTs to make a profit.\nIn addition to liquidity, it is also important to consider the market volume of the NFT industry. As with many businesses or industries that seem to explode overnight, the peak can be short-lived. So it\u0027s important to keep that in mind if you want to buy an NFT as a longer-term investment, rather than a piece of art to own or sell in a few months.\n‍Closing thoughts\nBuying and selling NFTs can certainly make you a lot of money, but there are countless mistakes you can make in your purchasing decisions if you are not well-informed. Cybercriminals are currently profiting greatly from the NFT industry, and some NFTs are simply not worth buying. Nonetheless, the rush for owning NFTs is growing every day, with more and more people and organizations choosing to be part of the industry.\nStart making money with NFTs now!\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "content": "A number of NFT marketplaces out there operate in a custodial way. What does this mean, and why do NFT creators and NFT collectors want a non-custodial NFT marketplace? Read on to find out.\nHow are they different?\nA custodial NFT marketplace manages and controls your wallet\u0027s private key and holds your NFTs in custody. In other words, a custodial NFT marketplace has full control over your NFTs, can manipulate your account and must give you permission to transfer your NFTs. The best example of a custodial NFT platform is the Binance NFT marketplace, where you must register or login with a registered account.\nA non-custodial NFT marketplace on the other hand gives NFT creators and NFT collectors complete ownership and control of their wallet and NFTs at all times. As a user, you can trade NFTs directly from your wallet. This eliminates third-party involvement, as a non-custodial platform uses smart contracts to enable any NFT transaction.\nBenefits of a non-custodial NFT marketplace\nThe main advantage of a non-custodial NFT marketplace is the NFT creator\u0027s full control over his NFTs and the ability to choose the type of NFT transaction fees. An NFT creator can move his NFTs at any time, even if the NFT marketplace is not running, since the private is kept on the user\u0027s crypto wallet and not on the NFT marketplace\u0027s.\nNon-custodial NFT marketplaces do not require any type of documentation to create or sell NFTs. In other words, as an NFT creator, you don\u0027t need to provide your ID or passport, just a legit or unique NFT asset to trade.\nWhat are the best non-custodial NFT marketplaces to mint NFTs?\nAirNFTs is entirely a non-custodial NFT marketplace that supports multichain NFTs like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Fantom. We do not have access to manipulate our users\u0027 NFTs or transfer their NFTs, as we would need their secret phrase to do so. Instead, their wallets own their NFTs and no one else can manage their NFTs. In this way, AirNFTs is more secure as an NFT marketplace for NFT collectors and NFT artists.\nOpenSea does not control or have custody of its users\u0027 NFTs. Your NFTs do not leave your wallet until they are sold because Opensea does not execute any purchase, sale or transfer of NFTs, nor does it control the blockchains you interact with.\nOn SuperRare, all NFT transactions are peer-to-peer, and no one has access to the funds or NFTs except those trading on the SuperRare NFT marketplace.\nWhen an NFT sale occurs on Rarible\u0027s NFT marketplace, the smart contract you agreed to when you listed your NFT activates and removes it from your wallet, depositing the funds owed to you in your wallet in exchange.‍\nFoundation will not take custody of your NFTs. The platform only serves as an NFT marketplace where NFT buyers and NFT sellers can connect. To store your NFTs, you will need to use a web3 wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\nClosing thoughts\nKnowledge of the key differences between custodial and noncustodial NFT marketplaces is intended to help NFT enthusiasts decide how best they want to secure and manage their NFTs.\nWant more control over your NFTs? With AirNFTs, you can mint on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon as well as Fantom (FTM) for less than a penny and have absolute control over your NFTs.‍\nGain control over your NFTs now!\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "On the Fantom NFT marketplace, NFT projects have proliferated as NFT artists and builders take advantage of the NFT marketplace’s low gas fees and fast transaction speeds that make it easy to create Fantom NFTs, customize and exchange NFTs.\nWhy Fantom NFT marketplace?\nWhile Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces have been making waves over the years, FTM, with its insane transaction speed and ridiculously cheap gas fees, is about to propel the NFT market even further.\nIn a word, the Fantom NFT marketplace is:\nWhen it comes to speed, Fantom NFT marketplace relies on its high-speed consensus mechanism, Lachesis, which allows tokens or NFT assets to run at unprecedented speeds.\nMinting on the Fantom NFT marketplace is both cheap and efficient. In other words, it costs less than a dollar to create your NFTs.\nFor NFT collectors, the resale value is probably the most important, mainly because of the size of the NFT marketplace. Since Fantom already operates on the AirNFTs marketplace, creating Fantom NFTs means exposing your digital works on the BSC and Polygon natives on the marketplace. High demand drives up prices and increases the chances of selling your digital works.\nWith staking and holding of FTM, owners can vote and propose some changes.\nHow does it work?\nIts functionality can be understood around the following key components:\nThe Fantom NFT marketplace ensures that each of the blockchain-powered networks is working independently of each other, which helps to scale these networks for performance independently without being too much worried about the congestion.\nAny technology product, in order to scale, must be highly decoupled and follow the principle of modularity. The Fantom blockchain has adopted this principle, which is made possible by Lachesis.\nThe Fantom NFT marketplace is secured by Proof-of-Stake. Unlike Proof-of-Work, used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, Proof-of-Stake prevents centralization and saves electricity. Lachesis can provide institutional-grade security to distributed networks. ‍\nLike most blockchain platforms, the Fantom blockchain is also open source and committed to creating building blocks that anyone can use and adapt to their needs. Also, because Fantom is permissionless, anyone can become a validator by running its node.\nHow to mint NFTs on Fantom NFT marketplace?\nThe Fantom NFT marketplace on AirNFTs works similarly to other networks.

    "content": "Crypto and Metaverse - A Match Made in Heaven?\nFrom extended realities to crypto and web 3.0, several projects are shaping up to hasten significant shifts in human interaction on the internet. And recently, metaverse talks have surged to the forefront, with more narratives and ideas being churned out, and big moves made almost every other week.\nThe promise of the metaverse, among many other things, is that it will provide an internet-enabled extended reality that will be device- and location-agnostic. Blockchain and crypto, among others, promise to reduce the cost of trust, bank the unbanked, and redefine digital ownership. A potential mix between crypto and metaverse looks more appealing, let\u0027s briefly look at some exciting prospects.\nThe Crypto Metaverse - Financialization\nThe first thing that comes to mind in this merger is financialization. Crypto helps with financializing assets in three ways— identity, digital ownership, and trade.\nThe metaverse will likely be an interplay of extended realities and a touch of web3, and of course, a valid identification will be needed. Now, it\u0027s unlikely that users will still subscribe to long, tiresome know-your-customer processes or side with a decentralized system where users\u0027 identities will be tied to a public address just like decentralized crypto wallets. Your crypto wallets are not only helpful in keeping your tokens; they can also be used to keep digital products like your avatars, clothings, accessories, weapons etc. You can decide to keep them in your wallet as a store of value or use them in other interoperable metaverses.\nTrade is fundamental to human nature, and it is essential to scale from the economic rent system riddling the current financial landscape if we\u0027re going to get anywhere. Stablecoins are an ideal fit for value exchange in the metaverse. By leveraging the borderlessness of crypto on the stability of fiat, buying and selling assets becomes seamless. And, of course, existing crypto marketplaces would foster sales of virtual lands and properties, especially cross-chain marketplaces like AirNFTs.\nBy now, everyone should probably know that the concept of digital ownership is changing thanks to NFTs. Assets in the metaverse will be well suited as NFTs as users can then secure immutable, publicly verifiable rights to use them and trade in marketplaces.\nCrypto and Metaverse: How Secure is it?\nBlockchain, the tech powering cryptocurrencies and NFTs, is arguably the most secure network we have right now. Transacting on a blockchain network, among other things, means decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Anyone who cares to check can easily see and verify all data at any time.\nThe Crypto Metaverse Already “Exists”\nAlthough still in the early days, the crypto-based virtual lands are already a thing, thanks to virtual land projects. SandBox, for example, aims to create a virtual metaverse where users can acquire properties, build, and even play games with haptic feedback. The project has attracted immense attention, and recently, Gucci announced that they are building their virtual shop in the game.\nDecentraland has also been gaining huge traction, JP Morgan launched their first metaverse lounge in the blockchain-based platform.\nConclusion: Is the Crypto Metaverse a Fad?\nWhile the metaverse and crypto are largely unexplored and can still morph to different shapes, the little we know shows that a potential mix will build on the existing internet in substantial ways. So it is reasonable to expect more positive news on developments over time.\nStay on the blog this year and follow all our socials to keep your fingers on the metaverse pulse.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "Best NFT Marketplaces for Music",
    "content": "The music industry may have finally started taking NFTs more seriously. A number of artists have launched music NFT projects that have increased fans\u0027 attention and generated millions of dollars in revenue. The NFT and crypto space is still in its infancy, especially in the music space, but perhaps the potential for more direct interaction between artists and fans, as well as new ways of monetizing digital works without resorting to traditional music publishers, make this a promising technological development.\nWhat are Music NFTs?\nIf you don\u0027t know what NFTs mean, we recommend you check out our previous article on what they are and if they are here to stay.\nNow, music NFT is a certificate of ownership of a unique musical work that can be sold to another party. The owner has the exclusive right to determine how the composition is used. The term “NFT” applies to all kinds of fungible (multiple copies exist and are held by different parties) tokens secured on a blockchain that grants the owner the right to the music, album art, or videos created to accompany the music, or other exclusive access to content.\nBeyond the strict definitions of what constitutes a non-fungible or fungible token, music NFTs help music composers, bands and artists connect and interact with their listeners in new ways.\nHow do they work?\nWhen producing or selling music NFTs, the principle remains the same as for other NFTs. A musician decides what he wants to sell to his fans, whether it is an audio file, NFT concert tickets or any other NFT merch. Then he/she determines on which blockchain he/she will mint the music NFT, or which music NFT marketplace he will use.\nAfter identifying the NFT marketplace of their choice, they will inform their fans of the release of their music NFT drop, and put them up for sale at the value they want to sell it.\nSince music NFTs (and all other NFTs) cannot be reproduced, they may decide to hold a one-time sale of an audio file, where the highest bidder owns the original audio file (but not the copyright). Or they may decide to create a limited number of music NFTs of the same audio file, say 20,000, and offer them for sale on a music NFT marketplace.\nEach fan who buys a music NFT becomes the owner of his favorite musician\u0027s work. He/she can then store the music NFTs in his/her cryptocurrency wallet or resell them later to a higher bidder. Although he/she owns the unique NFT and can sell it, the musician who created the NFT can make money by reselling his work, which is one of the most powerful ways that music NFTs can empower musicians.\nWhat do they solve?\nIn addition to earning income from immediate sales of music NFT, let\u0027s look at other ways in which NFTs can empower musicians:\nMusicians who create NFTs and sell them will earn on subsequent sales of their NFTs. This will alleviate the problem of musicians not making money on the sale of their work, or making only small amounts from centralized streaming services.\nMusic NFTs allow a musician to build an active fan base by creating a space in which fans can access unique NFTs related to the artist\u0027s work. For example, events such as NFT airdrops allow musicians to reach an audience they may not have had access to before.\nMusicians can also leverage unique experiences for their fans, such as giving them the opportunity to meet them virtually or in person. This is what musicians like Snoop Dogg did during his SandBox session, as well as Post Malone, who sold NFTs for people to play beer pong with him.\nOne of the main challenges musicians face is that they are usually under contract with a record label. On the other hand, most independent musicians make their money through streaming platforms. Music NFTs is a solution for both, as they allow musicians to make money by selling directly to their fans.\nSpotify only pays between $0.003 and $0.005 for each stream played, and many record labels pay even less. Subsequently, artists only make around 12% of the revenue that they create from the music industry. A tweet by @LucaLush shows the power of NFTs as they state a 1/1 NFT of their song sold for 0.45 ETH ($1734.40) which is equal to 2.5 million streams on a major label. Probably nothing, right? Wrong… this is massively bullish for Music NFTs because they bring power back to the creator, no matter their size. Fans follow creators, so it is only a matter of time before more artists adopt this kind of model, bringing more eyes and more money to the space.\nSome of the biggest names in music such as Kings of Leon, Wu-Tang Clan, and Nas have had some sort of involvement with music NFTs. Kings of Leon’s NFT drop provided multiple different tiers, with the lowest providing exclusive artwork and the most expensive known as a ‘Golden Ticket’. Each of these tickets guarantees the owner four front-row seats to one show of every Kings of Leon headline tour for life! With the cheapest currently listed on OpenSea for 333 ETH.\nHow to earn more with Music NFTs?\nWhat are the best NFT marketplaces for Music NFTs?\nOpenSea is by far the largest and most used platform for NFTs. And that includes music NFTs. Founded in 2017 and to date has done over USD 500M volume in NFT sales on the platform.\nIt doesn’t matter what NFT you want to create or sell, you can sell pretty much everything as NFT, including music NFTs, NFT games, and other NFT artworks. It’s interesting to note that the ERC-1155 and ERC-721 tokens are supported by the OpenSea platform, and every time a consumer purchases one of their products on OpenSea, the creators of NFT on OpenSea receive royalties. Also, the platform allows creators to mint NFTs via lazy minting, which means you can list NFTs for free without having to pay an ETH gas fee to do so.\nThe advantages of BSC and Polygon networks over the musical NFT are clear. They are faster, cheaper and extremely popular. This makes AirNFTs one of the best music NFT marketplaces for musicians entering this world for the first time. The low cost of entry is a key factor in attracting customers and creators.\nNFT Showroom is a digital art marketplace built on Hive. This is an NFT marketplace where rare items are sold. If you are an artist with unreleased songs, this might be the place for you. It\u0027s important to note that they only sell NFTs and do not offer minting services. Check out our previous article to discover the top blockchains where you can buy and mint your NFTs with low gas fees.‍\nSuperRare is a marketplace to collect and trade unique, single-edition digital artworks. It’s still in its infancy and only allows a small number of artists at the moment. But the artists are personally selected, which allows getting a certain exclusivity. Just know that they pay you 85% of the total price paid.‍\nThe Nifty Gateway NFT marketplace is quite large and is aimed specifically at music NFTs. It’s a centralized marketplace where a central authority controls every sale, minting, etc. If you\u0027re looking for a very curated selection of NFT, Nifty Gateway could be your marketplace of choice. It offers tri-weekly drops and has hosted renowned artists like Eminem, Grimes and The Weekend. However, unlike other more selective marketplaces, Nifty Gateway also offers a space for unverified creators looking to showcase their art.‍\nSound.xyz is a new startup looking to help emerging artists monetize their work more effectively through NFTs by releasing limited-time drops, as the startup looks to build out a suite of tools designed to bring musicians into the so-called “web3” fold. ‍\nRarible is another popular general NFT marketplace and, same as OpenSea, it allows creators to mint music NFTs via lazy minting. This is very useful for beginners as it cuts down the number of transactions they need to make and sell music NFTs.\nCatalog is a specialized marketplace for 1-of-1 NFT music releases.\nMint Songs is another music NFT marketplace running on the Polygon blockchain, helping music artists build web3 communities by building tools that enable music artists to turn their core creative assets into NFTs that they can sell and giveaway to their community. Users can mint their songs (audio + album artwork) into NFTs for $0 gas/network fees.‍\nAudius is aiming to use blockchain technology to democratize the music industry. It runs a streaming platform similar to Spotify, where artists can monetize their music NFTs via the native AUDIO token. It’s also slowly begun to move into the NFT space in recent months, allowing its users to connect their Ethereum and Solana music NFTs to their profiles.\nFinal thoughts\nWith some high-profile artists starting to bankroll serious pay using NFTs in the past year, the groundwork could be laid for yet another transformation of the music industry down the road.\nCan NFTs replace record labels and streaming giants? Probably not anytime soon. However, they represent a bold escape from the record company status quo, and they point to new avenues of self-sufficiency for musicians who have been preyed upon by middlemen for too long.\nStart earning with music NFTs now!\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "Top 10 NFT Games to Earn \u0026 Invest in 2022",
    "content": "Since their introduction, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have proven their ability to transform the gaming industry. In recent days, nothing has been more entertaining than blockchain-based NFT games. NFTs are bringing out a new era where crypto-gaming enthusiasts are going crazy for these exciting games, especially since they come with increased profitability that allows you to trade your items and in-game characters with other players. The majority of free NFT games promise a triple-digit percentage or more return on investment (ROI).\nWhat are NFT Games?\nVideo games are one of the markets where NFTs can play a role in driving growth, as they allow content developers to monetize their creations, while players can earn cryptocurrencies by engaging with the content.\nIn videos games, NFTs are used to create characters, avatars, and items that players can collect to facilitate their play and trade with other players. The value of an item depends on its use and rarity. Developers set up smart contracts that define how NFTs work in the game. The contracts are stored on the blockchain. In-game assets are traded as if they were physical assets. One of the first games with NFT characters was CryptoKitties, which launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain. In CryptoKitties, players collect, breed, and trade digital cats. Each cat is a unique NFT. Smart contracts define their characteristics and scarcity, which in turn determine their value on a given NFT marketplace, such as AirNFTs.\nSome Play-to-Earn NFT games are designed as metaverses, in which players can receive rewards for playing the game and advancing their skills. The games reward players with cryptocurrency tokens, which they can use to buy NFTs.\nIn this article, we present you the top 10 NFT games you should keep an eye on in 2022 according to DappRadar’s ranking. You will find some free-to-play NFT games, play-to-earn NFT games, and other blockchain games.\n1. Splinterlands\nSplinterlands is one of the most popular tradable free-to-play card games, with more than 260,000 users daily. It’s regarded as the currently most frequently played game in the blockchain space. Since it falls under the category of play-to-earn (P2E) top NFT games, you can earn non-fungible tokens and digital money just by merely playing it. To start playing this amazing NFT game, you need to purchase a starter pack of cards, the next step is to register a steam account that will allow you to unveil the cards you bought on Splinterlands.\n2. Aliens Worlds\nAliens Worlds is an impressive addition to the play-to-earn NFT games list. This is a play to earn metaverse-based game that has the ability to be built on numerous blockchains such as Ethereum, WAX, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The core of the game is based on the concept of exploration and mining, which leads to the discovery of in-game asset-based NFTs which are traded over secondary NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs.\n3. Farmers World\nFarmers World is one of the largest community of NFT games with over 150000 players all over the world and runs on the WAX NFT Blockchain. It’s also the first farming game to function on the NFTs platform and allows you to pick for yourself suitable tools, exploit various resources, buy land to build enormous farms, and enjoy the fascinating experiences of a farmer working in Farmers World’s Ecosystem.\n4. Axie Infinity\nAxie Infinity is a trading and battling NFT game in which players collect, breed, raise, battle, and trade creatures called Axies, which are digitized as NFTs. To be able to play, new players have to purchase at least three Axies. It’s a project based on both Ethereum and Ronin (an Ethereum sidechain built specifically for blockchain games), and players earn tokens that are cashed out every fourteen days. Assets that are collected in the game can be exchanged as NFTs, including virtual land.\n5. Upland\nUpland is a property trading game with real-world addresses. Users can buy, sell and trade virtual lands and properties replicated in the real world. By becoming a digital landowner, users can build properties and earn UPX coins (a fungible token on the EOS blockchain, similar to any cryptocurrency). The project uses blockchain to link each property on the Upland platform to an NFT.\n6. Crazy Defense Heroes\nCrazy Defense Heroes mobile game is the basis for an upcoming tower defense game on blockchain that uses NFTs and the TOWER ERC-20. The game will be a tower defense game, bringing the key elements of the Crazy Defense Heroes and Crazy Kings mobile games to the blockchain. Tower will be used as the main currency in the game, to purchase items such as NFT game cards, or to pay registration fees for games or tournaments.‍\n7. SecondLive\nSecondLive is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) based virtual life game where you become your ideal virtual avatar and do many real-life things in different spaces, such as virtual exhibitions, singing and dancing, shopping, and handling business.‍\n8. Bomb Crypto\nBomb Crypto is among the Play-To-Earn NFT games built on the BSC network, where players manage a group of bomb heroes or cyborgs programmed to search for BCOIN (the BEP20 token that allows holders to play, exchange, invest and also be part of the game ecosystem development) and fight monsters.‍\n9. Crypto Blades\nCryptoBlades is a play-to-earn NFT-Role Playing Game developed by Riveted Games. The game revolves around the acquisition of legendary Blades and the powerful Heroes who wield them. Players may participate in combat using their assets to earn SKILL tokens (the governance token for the game). Assets are players-owned NFTs minted to the ERC-721 standard and may be traded on the proprietary marketplace. CryptoBlades utilizes a play-to-earn model by distributing SKILL gameplay and giving value to player NFTs by increasing their use through future features. CryptoBlades can grow and reward like no other game on the internet, thanks to the power of blockchain and BSC.‍\n10. DeFi Kingdoms\nDeFi Kingdoms (DFK) is a game, a decentralized exchange (DEX), a liquidity pool (LP) opportunity, and a market of rare utility-driven NFTs, that all plays out seamlessly in the incredibly nostalgic form of fantasy pixel art. DeFi Kingdoms blends the appeal of decentralized finance and the current rise of Play-to-Earn economics. It is live on both Avalanche and the Harmony ONE network.\nConclusion\nNFT games mix popular game genres with aspects of blockchain, making them particularly useful for establishing rarity and uniqueness. Currently, play-to-earn NFT games have proven to be the most dominant force in the crypto space. By now, you should be familiar with NFTs in the gaming industry, as well as the opportunity for gamers and entrepreneurs to profit from them.\nKeep an eye on our blog and social networks to keep up with NFT trends.\nFollow us on\nBlockchain games like Axie Infinity allow you to buy and sell objects, land, and characters in the game. This works just like blockchains and NFTs, meaning you can profit by minting your character or a series of characters as NFTs.\nIf you want to get started with play-to-earn games, you\u0027ll need a crypto wallet. This will allow you to connect to the game and purchase NFTs. Try popular wallets such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask.\nScammers behind NFT scam games usually plan and execute their schemes on a grand scale. They often target novice investors instead of experts and use attractive websites and advertisements to entice inexperienced users.\nNFT games are generally accessed via PC, but most already provide NFT game platforms that can be accessed using other devices, such as iOS and Android.\nPlay-to-earn and NFT games strive to establish a gaming ecosystem that prioritizes players by granting them ownership of their in-game assets and providing rewards for their engagement in gaming activities.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "Is 2022 the Metaverse Year?",
    "content": "This year, the metaverse has been the poster word of most tech and crypto websites. Tech analysts have been theorizing the next iteration of the internet, an idea where users get to interact and live many lives (with avatars) in a non-physical world. This abstract term, often traced to a dystopian novel in the early ’90s, has become the highlight of the tech industry discourse, thanks to big institutional moves, including the Facebook rebrand and Roblox’s initial public offering.\nOf course, every frontier in tech offers opportunities to propel humanity forward and ultimately make lives easier. But, on the flip side, solutions must be critically examined, and from the investor’s perspective, the prospect is what matters, and this piece briefly looks at the potential outlook for the metaverse in 2022.\nWhat is the Metaverse?\nDefining the metaverse is quite complicated, since it doesn’t exist yet. In attempts to narrow things down, people tend to conflate the metaverse with existing immersive tech such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR). VR headsets have been with us for a while, and, of course, we do love our Oculus Quest 2, which is now called Meta Quest 2, by the way. AR (think Snapchat’s dogs and Niantic’s Pokémon Go) has also taken off, and we see more utilities with MR. These technologies extend reality by immersing users in a digital environment with applications in numerous domains.\nWhile the metaverse will likely interplay these technologies, analysts believe the metaverse will offer a lot more with internet-enabled real-time 3D software and apps. Users will interact using avatars, play games, acquire lands and properties, and trade in shared virtual worlds. What’s more, the metaverse will be accessed on all devices and is location-independent. As a result, anybody with an internet-enabled device will be able to live a virtual life seamlessly.\nThe Race to the Metaverse in 2022: Developments and Investments\nAs with any new frontier, there is usually a lot of buzz in the air. The metaverse is currently at the heart of its hype cycle, as evidenced by investments and the acquisition of human talents.\nInvestments are key to the growth of any sector, and we are seeing some groundwork in acquisitions and fundings already. For example, Microsoft recently bought Activision, the gaming company, in a $68.7 billion deal. The purchase gives them IP rights to notable games, including Minecraft and Call of Duty. Grand Theft Automakers also recently announced that they acquired FarmVille maker– Zynga in a $13 billion deal. Key VCs recognize potentials as well. SoftBank, for example, invested up to $150 million in a South Korean metaverse company recently.\nBig techs like Meta and Microsoft are working overtime to get ahead of the curve and snatch that first-mover advantage. Aside from Facebook’s complete rebranding to The Meta Inc, chipmaker Nvidia has also launched Omniverse— a metaverse project to allow creators to simulate projects in an online platform. One of their participants is BMW, the automobile company. Crypto-native projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox are also setting sights on metaverse dominance as they keep introducing more features in their virtual worlds.\nIt is clear that more people now see the metaverse as the next evolution of the internet— one that will probably pivot a much bigger shift in human interaction and behavior than the dot-com web.\nThe Takeaway: Metaverse in 2022\nThe metaverse is an incredibly broad idea, and considering the vast infrastructure required, it will probably not advance quickly enough for the believers. However, it is reasonable to expect more news on acquisitions and key advances in 2022, as current developments move apace and more tech giants (crypto or not) join in to pivot this transformation shift in our digital lives.\nKeep a tab on all metaverse news on the blog.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "How to sell an NFT at higher price with auctions",
    "content": "One of the most popular people to auction off an NFT was Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter. He wasn\u0027t the first, but since then we\u0027ve seen other NFT auctions involving ridiculous amounts of money. Not only is the hype around NFTs becoming real, but a person can now spend millions of dollars on NFT auctions to purchase digital art from the comfort of their home.\nWhether you’re an NFT collector or an NFT creator, understanding how NFT auctions work is one of the first steps to making the most of this industry.\n‍What are NFT auctions?\nNFT auctions are where specific NFT artworks are offered for sale to interested NFT collectors and the highest bidders place their bids to purchase the NFT artwork. In an NFT auction, the seller sets a minimum price for a given period. Buyers can bid on the amount they wish to spend on the NFT, provided it is above the minimum price. Then the NFT is sold to the highest bidder at the end of the auction period.\nHow does an NFT auction work?\nNot all NFT marketplaces run their NFT auctions in the same way. If you want to run an automated, timed NFT auction, you can set up a reserve auction or a scheduled auction.\nIn a reserve auction, a public reserve price is set. Once it is reached, it sets off a 24-hour countdown to the end of the auction, allowing other collectors to bid before the deadline. Reserve auctions work well when you are not in a hurry to sell an NFT art piece, but want to get at least some money for it. Once the reserve price is set, there is no specific time frame in which it must be reached - but when it is, the timer goes off.\nIn a scheduled auction, specific start and end times are chosen, along with an optional starting price. The auction will start and end at approximately the specified times, regardless of whether bids reach the starting price. Scheduled auctions are ideal when you know you want to sell an NFT during a specific time period, as part of an event, or to make the auction an event in its own right.\nWhy should you use NFT auctions?\nOnce an item, including an NFT, leaves the hands of the first buyer, the principle of supply and demand determines its subsequent market value. Other factors that add value to an NFT are human stipulation, rarity, and the collective intentionality of the auction process. Despite the reserve or minimum price of any NFT, it’s the market that determines the final value of the NFT in an auction. In other words, each person participating in an NFT auction is unconsciously an evaluator of the NFT itself. In summary, the more bids an NFT auction receives, the higher the value of the NFT until it’s sold.\nIf you’re getting ready to release your NFT, and you think you’re going to sell out, you should consider an auction.\nHow to auction an NFT on the AirNFTs NFT marketplace?\nThe process of auctioning an NFT starts with the creation of the NFT. Find out how to create and sell your own NFT in our previous article.\nAfter creating your NFT, follow the steps below to auction it on our NFT marketplace:\n1. Click on profile picture, then on “My NFTs,”\n2. Scroll down to your collection and click on the NFT you want to auction,\n3. Modify your NFT price to match the final price you would love to get if the auction has bidders to avoid front-run attacks – we’ll explain this later in this article,\n3. Click on more icon and hit “Start Timed Auction,”\n4. Indicate the Minimum Bid and the duration of the auction, then click on \"Confirm,\"\n5. A smart contract call will pop up, click “Approve,”\n6. Wait a few seconds for confirmation, you will receive a notification at the top of your screen that the auction has been successfully created.\nAnd there you have it, your first NFT has been auctioned on AirNFTs NFT marketplace.\nNote: If the NFT you wish to auction has an initial low price when you send it to the escrow account, someone can buy it within 5 seconds before the escrow account locks it. On the other hand, if the NFT was priced higher, before, that front running (attack) can be avoided.\n‍Conclusion\nHopefully, you\u0027ve learned that using auctions to sell your NFTs will give you and your users a great result. If you\u0027re working on an NFT project and plan to launch it, we recommend being frugal with your time and doing it from AirNFTs, an NFT marketplace running on both the Polygon and BSC blockchains, for low or near-zero gas/network fees.\nCheck our previous article to learn more about where you can mint and buy your NFTs with low gas fees.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "Where to mint and buy NFTs with low gas fees",
    "content": "During your journey of learning about cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH), and NFTs, you must have come in contact with the term \"gas fees\" or \"network fees\". But do you have a clear idea of what a \"gas fee\" is and why it’s a fundamental part of NFT minting? Let’s break it down together.\nWhat are gas fees?\nIf you have a car, you need to fill it up with fuel to operate it. In other words, that fuel is the cost you incur to enjoy the convenience of driving your car or vehicle. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the transaction fees that users pay to get their smart contracts into the blockchain are called \"gas fees\". The value of these fees varies depending on the rate of demand for that specific cryptocurrency in the market. But it also depends on how fast you are willing to mint your NFTs, i.e. how fast the minting process is. The faster you want to go, the more you have to pay to NFT marketplaces and cryptocurrency networks.\nWhere to mint your NFTs with low gas fees?\nIf you\u0027re familiar with Ethereum (ETH), you know that whether you\u0027re trying to send tokens from one wallet to another, or exchange tokens on a decentralized exchange, or send money from your own wallet to your own centralized exchange account, the gas fees have become outrageous. Since it\u0027s so expensive to mint and trade your NFTs on the Ethereum Mainnet, we\u0027re going to look at three alternatives to Ethereum that you can use to mint and trade your art NFTs, music NFTs, video NFTs, gift NFTs, or anything else you want to create. We’ll also discuss platforms you can use on each of these blockchains.\n1. Polygon\nIn the face of rising gas fees, Polygon (MATIC) is the real alternative to Ethereum. Indeed, it’s a Layer 2 protocol built on top of Ethereum, so it has all the advantages of Ethereum and processes more than 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, with much lower fees (by more than 1000 times) compared to the Ethereum network. Additionally, with Polygon NFT Marketplace, you have the advantage of having access to at least one of the NFT marketplaces that we know well, namely AirNFTs.\n2. Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\nThe Binance Smart Chain, was created as a parallel chain to solve the problem of smart contracts on the main Binance NFT Marketplace. Unlike Ethereum, it’s much cheaper, however, like Ethereum, it’s built on the same Ethereum virtual machine architecture. BSC reaches a maximum of 160 transactions per second. This is neither good nor close to Polygon, but much better than Ethereum. On BSC, the average cost per transaction is about 15 cents. This is still higher than Polygon but significantly lower than Ethereum. There are a couple of platforms you can use to create, buy, sell or gift your NFTs on BSC, such as AirNFTs.‍\n3. Solana\nThe Solana NFT Marketplace is a decentralized blockchain designed to enable scalable, user-friendly dapps worldwide. It uses a proof-of-stake algorithm to enable ultra-fast transactions at extremely low costs per transaction. Solana has over a thousand network of validators that can do up to 50,000 transactions per second, and the average cost per transaction is $0.00025. Some of the most popular NFT marketplaces on Solana include Solsea and Magic Eden. Since AirNFTs plans to be a multichain NFT marketplace, there is a high probability of running for Solana as well.‍\n4. Avalanche\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a smart contract enabled blockchain platform focused on fast transactions, low costs, environmental friendliness, and allows you to mint your own art NFTs, In-game NFTs, collectibles and any other type of NFT you want to create in seconds for less than a cent. Popular Avalanche NFT marketplaces include NFTrade and Kalao NFT marketplace.\nConclusion\nThe popularity of the NFT market space is rapidly growing, with more people signing up every day. However, to mint your digital art collection, you need to spend money. If you don\u0027t want to use each marketplace on a different blockchain, you can use all-in-one with AirNFTs, an NFT marketplace on the Polygon and BSC blockchains.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "If you’re looking for a platform to swap Binance coins (BNB) for Polygon (MATIC) coins, you can use Binance or KuCoin as convenient and quick options to do so. On the other hand, if you don’t have Binance or KuCoin and want to use DEX without registering anywhere you can go to letsexchange.io/, their BNB to Polygon online exchange chooses the best conversion rate. It allows you to use only your private wallet and no registration or KYC is required to start trading.\nHowever, don\u0027t panic if your BNB is not exchanged within a day, these cross-chain exchanges sometimes take more than 8 hours or even a full day to complete.\nWhat is Polygon?\nFormerly known as the Matic Network, Polygon is a scaling solution that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling fast transactions with low gas fees. MATIC is the network\u0027s native cryptocurrency that is used for fees, staking, and more. It also functions as a platform for building and connecting Ethereum-enabled blockchain networks.\nPolygon reduces transaction fees on the Ethereum network while dramatically increasing the speed of transactions. The protocol enables instant transactions that cost a fraction of a penny ($0.002). Its focus on scalability is what makes it very attractive to decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain.\nUniswap, for example, announced that it has deployed Uniswap V3 on Polygon on December 22, 2021.\nWhy do you need MATIC?\nImagine paying four times as much for transaction fees as you would for a real NFT. Ethereum\u0027s gas/network fees are insane, and that\u0027s where Polygon comes in. To remedy this insanity.\nThe network aims to evolve Ethereum by reducing transaction fees and improving its usability. It uses Proof-of-stake side chains (such as PoS and zk Rollups) and can execute thousands of transactions per second.\nSeveral scaling solutions are under development, but only one is currently in use, the Matic network (Polygon PoS chain today). Due to its low fees and compatibility with Ethereum, it is very attractive for many DeFi protocols to launch on its PoS chain.\nOnce you have MATIC you can go ahead and swap it for AIRT on Polygon to pay auction network/gas fees on the NFT marketplace. You can as well use MATIC to pay network fees and bridge your currently owned AIRT from BSC to Polygon.\nCurrent AIRT holders can use Multichain-Cross-Router Protocol to bridge their AIRT Token on BSC to Polygon without any problems. They only need MATIC to cover the network fees. Multichain (formerly known as Anyswap) is a Cross-Chain Router Protocol (CRP) that supports cross-chain interoperability of tokens, NFTs, and general data across multiple chains.\n‍How does Multichain work?\n1. In your Trust Wallet or MetaMask Wallet, open the in-app browser, and use the following link to trade: app.multichain.org/. In this case, we’ll use Trust Wallet,\n2. Click the drop-down menu to select AIRT, then scroll down and click “Approve AIRT” to let the smart contract interact with it,\n3. Click on “Swap” then “Confirm.” Please wait patiently as the transaction may take from 3 to 30 minutes.\n4. Your transaction is done when Status changes into “Success”\n5. Check cross-chain transaction status by pasting your Polygon (MATIC) Wallet address on Multichain Explorer.\nHow to swap BNB to MATIC on LetsExchange?\nAfter funding your Trust Wallet or MetaMask wallet, to convert Binance Coin (BNB) to Polygon (MATIC), open the in-app browser, and use this link to trade: https://letsexchange.io/\n1. On the page, choose the coin that you wish to exchange and the number of coins,\n2. Choose the cryptocurrency to buy,\n3. Provide the wallet address to get the exchanged funds,\n4. The next step is depositing the coins needed for the exchange for MATIC,\n5. The system will search the best BNB to MATIC exchange rate, and the transaction will be completed.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

With over $100million invested in this project, it is a safe NFT project to invest in.\n3. Sodativity\n‍Sodativity is a collection of artworks from Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC) and Doodles, with 9,999 artworks created. With a floor price of 0.1Eth and an ever-growing community, SODA (as the community is commonly called) aims to increase ownership of their NFT assets and give back to the community from their proceeds.\n4. CryptoPunks\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, you would have heard of CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks is an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain. There are 10,000 unique punks generated through computer algorithms, hence no two punks look alike. The rarity of these characters makes them a statement of status in the NFT community, and we expect the values of CryptoPunks to remain up there.\n5. Feudalz\nLike CryptoPunks, Feudalz is a community of 4,444 computer-generated art collectibles that operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Feudalz aims to bring peace and prosperity to every one of their owners (who are called Peasants) and has a promise of virtual lands in the metaverse coming to the project very soon.\n6. Doodles\nDoodles is an NFT collection of 10,000 unique characters on uniquely colored backgrounds, created by Burnt Toast. As with most other NFT collections, it is a community-driven project. Apart from minting and scaling value with Doodles assets, this community allows the holders to vote for experiences and activations paid for by the Doodles Community Treasury.\n7. Chain Runners\nThere are 10,000 Chain Runners available in the collection, and it has gained so much traction due to its solid decentralized, open-source codebase. Buying one seems more like being a member of a special gang, and with the prices rising at alarming rates, it is a good project to invest in.\n8. CollectVox\nCollectVox’s collection contains 8,888 rare and distinct characters called ERC721 with a floor price of 0.0888Eth. Each of the characters has their own identities: facial appearance, job and personality. When you own a VOX, you get a file that allows you to animate and play with them in the metaverse. Seems like a fun project to invest in.\n9. Dormant Dragons\n‍Dormant dragons is a set of 5000 artworks that is community-centered. The creators aim to achieve true community by giving holders of Dormant Dragons a token called Smoke which can be claimed at any time, without dealing with high gas fees. These tokens will be used for things such as community engagement, potential babies, and video games. To reward members who are active in the community, they have regular giveaways on their Discord channel.\n10. JRNY NFT Club\nJRNY NFT Club is a membership NFT that grants you access to future JRNY NFT sets, private community chat and announcements, exclusive NFT videos, early access to partner NFT projects and much more. It contains 10,000 collectibles at a floor price of about 2.346Eth. If you plan to ape into this project, there is much in store, as they have a lot of long-term utility planned for holders, which they plan to show the community in their roadmaps (to be released quarterly).\n11. Gas Squad\nGas Squad is a collection of 1111 originally generated soldiers with hundreds of unique elements. Each soldier has his own story and character, as each has been in many gas battles. Your mission is to evacuate soldiers, create a squad, and deploy your warriors to the safe expanse of the BSC network. If you are holding 2 or more soldiers, you automatically participate in regular giveaways of NFT-art.\n12. Launchpad Air Squad\nLaunchpad Air Squad is an exclusive NFT project running on the AirNFTs marketplace with a limited edition of 14,000 NFTs with unique AirNFTs branding, minted only for participants of the first ever NFT Launchpad.\n\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "What are Virtual Lands",
    "content": "Have you heard terms like \"virtual lands,\" \"virtual worlds\" or \"virtual real estate\"? These environments have gained popularity since the pandemic prompted people to spend more time online, but if this is the first time you\u0027ve heard them, you may be wondering what they really mean. Let’s explore these concepts together.\nReal estate refers to property consisting of land and the buildings on it, as well as its natural resources such as water and trees. In other words, real estate is a term that implies physical, tangible property. On the other hand, Virtual Land is intangible and only exists in the virtual world. Just like physical land, it’s also sold in the form of plots and can be purchased using the cryptocurrency of the land in question, like MANA in Decentraland. NFT categories, such as art, collectibles, and domain names, are all leveraged in the metaverse, with ecosystems built and maintained by the crypto community. So the only essential difference is the tangibility of the two worlds. However, this doesn\u0027t mean that you can\u0027t enjoy the virtual world or that it has no value. On the contrary, nowadays, with the invention of NFTs, the game has changed dramatically, allowing for more secure and future-proof purchases. Virtual lands are becoming more valuable and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are paying real money to acquire them. NFT technology is then used to facilitate the ownership, buying, and selling of these land parcels.\nTill date, there are several virtual worlds (such as Decentraland, Sandbox, and Earth2) that allow the purchase of virtual land. The most popular among such worlds is Decentraland. It’s a specific type of metaverse that uses blockchain technology where land and other items are sold in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which in turn represent ownership of a digital asset in the metaverse (a bunch of interconnected virtual worlds). The average price of land in Decentraland currently stands at around $195,779.94.\nAs our lives become increasingly digital, the prospect of owning a piece of digital land no longer seems far-fetched. Thanks to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), investors can gain a sense of ownership over intangible assets like LAND. Although, when it comes to using virtual land, many people are confused and the question is usually whether it is worth it or not. Well, the answer is YES for the following reasons:\nFurthermore, the world of virtual reality allows users to be not only consumers but also creators. Users can produce their own unique creations in these virtual worlds and sell them. Virtual land plots can be bought and sold on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. Simply register an account and link a digital wallet such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask.\nAs the virtual world experience is taking hold, AirNFTs is already allowing you to immerse yourself in that experience, to create and monetize your NFTs as pieces of virtual land. ‍\nWhile the dream of owning land has always been firmly rooted in the real world, things have changed in the 21st century, where many people have purchased parcels of virtual real estate in the metaverse. If our future is going to be virtual, you’ll want to get in quick.\nStart earning with virtual lands now!\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "Reports highlight that NFT trading volume hit more than US$10 billion in the last quarter. This represents a staggering 38,000% increase over the previous year, and global brands and financial tycoons are paying scrupulous attention. With a number of large-scale, high-profile investments in the technology, it\u0027s pretty clear that NFTs are quickly outgrowing their usefulness as digital works of art. They are digital tokens of virtual and real-world assets that can be applied to any item.\nAs the boom of unique collectibles on social media platforms inevitably fades, the second wave of NFT adoption - already in its infancy - will show that the technology\u0027s universal adaptability can have a significant impact on all of our lives.\nGiven their familiarity with the concept of alternative currencies and virtual worlds, gamers are an ideal target market for NFTs. NFTs allow in-game items to be tokenized and easily transferred or traded on P2P markets, such as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Decentraland is one of the best examples of games that use a blockchain marketplace. It’s permanently owned by its community and gives its players full control over their creations and virtual assets.\nOther NFT-based online video games include Sky Mavis\u0027 Axie Infinity, a Pokémon-like game that has surpassed 2 million daily active users, and Battle Pets, a blockchain game about adorable pets running on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Learn more about Gaming NFT Marketplace here.\nA typical example is event ticketing, where NFTs can help solve a number of problems that event organizers face, such as fraud and ticket resale. NFTs make it easy to verify the authenticity of a ticket and transfer ownership in a secure and seamless manner. The transaction made by purchasing an NFT ticket is stored immutably on the blockchain and is then easily verifiable by the event host. Any secondary sales or unauthorized portfolio transfers can also be easily identified.\nJust like an image or video file, musicians can attach their audio tracks to NFTs and create a collectible piece of music. However, with the decline of physical and digital downloads, music artists depend on streaming revenue, which tends to disproportionately reward middlemen like streaming platforms and record companies. The unequal distribution of income in the music industry is a long-standing issue, and NFTs are an opportunity for artists to regain control of their music through smart contracts embedded in the blockchain underlying NFTs. Learn more about how to create your own music NFTs here.\nIf you’re a creator, we recommend you visit our marketplace to make your own NFTs. You can mint and sell them to your user base.\nYes, it makes sense to have a domain name as an NFT. You can use NFT domains as your universal username across apps and websites, website URL, payment address for wallets, and much more. This type of domain ownership allows you to replace cryptocurrency addresses with a human-readable name. Examples of cryptocurrency platforms that offer this service include Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Unstoppable Domains. Now, you may be wondering about the benefits of domain names that live on public blockchains.\nFirst, keep in mind that blockchains are decentralized, which has a number of implications. When you purchase, for example, philip.eth or philip.crypto, you own it forever. In other words, you’re buying a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. On the other hand, if you buy philip.com, you’re renting access to the name to an organization that manages lists of domain names on servers it controls. Reason why you have to pay every year to renew a .com domain name. Another advantage is that, since you actually own the NFT/domain name, if you want to transfer the domain name to someone else, you can do so instantly by simply sending the NFT to another address. In the traditional DNS world, you’d have to wait, sometimes for weeks or months, for an intermediary to authorize your transfer.\nWe spoke about this in the post “Top Three Reasons Why NFTs are Viable Long Term Assets”, but let’s review.\nNFTs can be used to verify ownership of real-world assets such as houses, cars, etc. As with other applications, NFTs can help prevent people from reselling assets that do not belong to them. In other words, you won’t be able to scam ownership. Decentraland is a user-owned, Ethereum-based virtual world that makes it possible to purchase parcels of land on which to build your own environments, marketplaces, and applications. Using NFTs to purchase objects and areas ensures that the original owners are identified.\nNFTs contain unique information stored in their tokens. These tokens can be used to verify documents such as degrees, certifications, driver\u0027s licenses, medical records, passports, birth and death certificates, and other qualifications. The main reason is to prevent fraud and streamline verification processes. Blockcerts is an example of a blockchain platform that creates apps that deliver blockchain-based records for academic credentials, professional certifications, and other civic records.\nOne important positive contribution that NFTs could make to the supply chain and logistics is the accurate traceability and control of a specific item. They ensure that supply chain data remains authentic and reliable, such as its current owner, location, and characteristics such as weight, size, and certifications. This information is updated in the NFT, which remains stored in the blockchain network as the product moves through the supply chain. When items arrive at their destination, a reliable and detailed history of their entire journey from origin to delivery can be accessed. The added benefit is the nature of NFTs to represent unique items.\nConclusion\nWith many use cases entering the real world and adding tremendous value to people\u0027s lives, it’s only a matter of time before we see the mass adoption of NFTs. We’ll see the creators’ economy change as they will have more control over their work and will be able to monetize it in many ways, and guess what? We’ve got you covered. You can monetize your creative works for less than a dollar on AirNFTs. Visit our marketplace today to get started.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "title": "Best NFT wallets for storing and trading NFTs",
    "content": "While cryptocurrency wallets started as applications for sending and receiving cryptocurrencies, the rise of NFTs and DeFi projects has seen many wallets adapt and specialize in providing secure access to NFT users. A cryptocurrency wallet is an app that allows cryptocurrency users to store and retrieve their digital assets. It provides \"private keys\" or passwords that allow its holder to access funds and assets stored on the blockchain. So, if you want to start collecting NFTs, a wallet will be an essential tool to get started. Storing your NFTs correctly is paramount to escaping all forms of theft and other forms of scams. It goes beyond passwords and two-factor authentication, as you will need the right kind of NFT platform and crypto wallet to protect your assets.\nIn total, there are 2 main types: hardware wallet and mobile wallets. Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages and is therefore suitable for different types of people.\nWhich wallets are best for NFTs?\nWhen choosing the best NFT wallet, you can choose between hardware or mobile wallet. Hang on, as we explore the best options together.\nOne of the best features of the Trust Wallet is that it’s a very beginner-friendly platform. Unlike some more-complicated wallets out there, Trust Wallet is going to be suitable for all beginner NFT collectors. If you’re new to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, this is a highly recommended option to start with. With this option, you can store a number of NFTs such as Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). However, Trust Wallet is only available on mobile devices (yes, that\u0027s right). You won\u0027t be able to use it on your browser or software on your PC or laptop. You can use NFTs with your Trust Wallet on iOS by connecting through Wallet Connect.\nCreated by Consensys and launched in September 2016, MetaMask is considered to be the best wallet for interacting with decentralized applications and the most popular wallet for buying and storing NFTs.\nIn itself, MetaMask is super simple to install and use. You can access it from your browser or download it as a mobile wallet. This simplicity is because, even if you\u0027re not a cryptocurrency enthusiast and have never heard of Ethereum, MetaMask will allow you to take it easy and learn the ropes at your own pace.\nMetaMask also gives you access to a DeFi and NFT browser on your mobile device. This will allow you to stay on top of market trends, without the need to have your laptop with you or to use a default web browser.\nOne area in which MetaMask is lacking, however, is security. This is not all that surprising, given that it is a \"hot wallet\" - mobile and browser-based wallets will never outperform hardware wallets in terms of security. With MetaMask, however, this problem is even greater. In fact, of all the mobile wallets on the market, MetaMask is certainly one of the most plagiarized.\n‍With MyEther Wallet (MEW) you can view and manage all your collectibles domains in MEW’s NFTs manager. MEW supports other Ethereum-enabled networks, including Ethereum Classic (ETC), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Polygon, so users can manage assets beyond the main Ethereum network. It has seamless communication with smart contracts by occupying ERC-20 tokens. It\u0027s touted as one of the best wallets for storing digital assets online.\nA decade ago, being a great gamer was not a profitable skill, but currently, it’s a cool way to earn money. There are games where you can earn NFT collectibles as rewards.\nAn amazing NFT storage option with specific designs for gamers is the Enjin wallet. With this option, you have no restrictions on using a particular cryptocurrency. With features like biometrics and auto-lock to boost security, Enjin will keep your NFT assets safe. It’s also important to mention that the Enjin wallet is also exclusive to mobile devices. You will not be able to download and use the wallet on your laptop or PC.\nThe Coin98 mobile wallet makes it possible for users to send, receive and manage all their NFTs in one place, through an attractive UI. Users can now search, track and view NFT collections easily.\nAs long as you carefully keep your seed phrase, your NFT will be safe. Coin 98 Wallet provides a cosmos for safe, straightforward handling and storage of your own NFTs.\nA hardware wallet is the most secure option for storing NFTs because all your digital assets and NFT data are offline. It’s impossible to hack. If you’re looking to store NFTs for a long time wallet like Ledger Nano X might be your fit.\nNo one can transfer the data contained in a hardware storage wallet off the device unless they know your secret phrase (12 words). Therefore, no one but you has access to this data. You can also combine your hardware wallet with other online wallets like MetaMask.\nKey takeaways\nKeep an eye on airnfts.com and follow us on our social media platforms today to stay informed about best practices in the world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "title": "How to Flip NFTs for Profit",
    "content": "Unless you have been living under a rock, you will have heard of NFTs and the colossal disruption they’re bringing into the digital space. Average monthly trading volumes went from $64M in the first half of this year to more than $750M in the second half. Now, the party is still very much on, and we are seeing random Twitter users flipping artworks for thousands of dollars. Although you may not sell for that much, the good news is that you can also tune in and earn some money. Let’s delve right into it.\nWhat is Flipping?\nFlipping is a loose term for buying items at low prices and selling quickly for a profit. It’s existed forever— from the days of flipping trading cards, toys, and comics for profit, and we’re now seeing an enormous wave in the NFT space.\nWhy Flip NFTs?\nYou can only flip valuable stuff, and NFTs have proven to be valuable, rapidly attracting all sorts of investors. Besides holding Bitcoin and Alts or creating and collecting tokenized art for the long term, you might want to get in on high-volume NFT projects for quicker returns. Although risky, flipping NFTs is a relatively fast way to boost your portfolio.\nHow to Spot Hot NFT Projects\nAs with any financial market, making profits requires analyzing metrics to make the best possible decision. Generally, people always go for assets that are currently undervalued or they expect to increase in value.\nWith NFTs, you need to find your niche and do quality research. Common niches include animal-themed art, abstract paintings, collectibles, domain names, or even virtual pieces of land.\nAmong other factors, three key metrics primarily determine how well an NFT project will do. These are:\nWhere to Spot NFT Projects\n1. Special sections on NFT platforms\nNFT platforms are doing an excellent job guiding users into potentially hot assets. For example, the “Top Artists” and “Exclusive Drops” sections on AirNFTs are good places to look at when considering buying. The Rankings and Activity pages on OpenSea also provide some insight into potentially great projects.\n2. Social media\nFree alpha is now everywhere, thanks to social media. You probably already know that artists and known NFT influencers often announce new projects on their social media pages— Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, Discord, and Instagram. Keeping tabs on their pages is a good idea. Also, NFT platforms have social media accounts where they often promote their users’ projects.\nGetting Started\nFlipping NFTs follows a simple process. You need a Web3 compatible wallet like Metamask or Trust Wallet. After funding your account, you can access various NFT platforms using the in-app browser. AirNFTs is the perfect place to start your flipping journey. You can buy NFTs with ridiculously cheap gas fees and make a significant fortune from them, thanks to our ever-growing and active community.\nOn selling, it’s essential to know when to sell as a flipper. While that decision solely lies on you, it is crucial to monitor the volume and recognition the project is getting while taking care to move on to other projects.\nNote: You must remember that NFTs are not as liquid as their fungible counterparts, meaning you can only make a profit as long as you see buyers willing to buy. Hence, you must take care to invest what you can afford to lose.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "title": "Top Three Reasons Why NFTs are Viable Long-term Assets",
    "content": "Everyone knows the non-fungible token market has taken the world by a storm this year. The space has recorded more investor presence— retail and institutional— and you too have probably made some fortune from them. Although critics still find it hard seeing more to it than a bubble where Gen Z’ers keep finding jpegs to flip for profit, it is becoming clearer by the minute that NFTs are here to stay— for the very reasons that came to the fore. As NFTs chart their way atop the viable assets class, it becomes more crucial than ever to remind ourselves of the reasons they are valuable. This short piece highlights three reasons why NFTs might be viable long-term assets.\n1. Ownership\nBy now you must already know that NFTs solve the ownership problem thanks to its underpinning tech, blockchain (if you are uninitiated, refer to articles on the blog to get in).\nConsidering how NFTs leverage blockchain\u0027s attributes, it’s quite understandable why millennials and Gen Z’ers are onto it. The world wants to be free of middlemen and central authorities. More people are now exploring DAOs, establishing community-based ownership by using a proof-of-stake model. NFTs introduce a new paradigm in the creative industry. Digital artists, musicians, writers, memers, doodlers, whatever. You can now own your stuff and sell it directly to people.\n2. GameFi\nThe online gaming industry has always been a huge one and NFTs have real potential to revolutionize it. NFTs create ways for gamers to profit off of their in-game purchases. Gamers will be able to exchange game accessories such as wears, weapons, or even special abilities, in a shared economy. Game developers might also incentivize gamers by allowing them to collect and trade rare collectibles on NFT marketplaces. The same tokens might even be usable for different games developed by the same company.\n3. Greater Visibility\nThe growth of any space is hinged on visibility and NFTs have fared pretty well in that for obvious reasons. A major one that is often underrated is creating ecosystems. NFTs are bringing creatives together making room for potential partnerships, and building strong markets around creatives and their fans. Anyone on the globe with an internet connection can put their works online, sell to others or partner with other creatives to produce more valuable products. Creators sell at fair prices, buyers can pay in different tokens, fostering a flexible buyer-seller relationship.\nConclusion\nOpinions on NFTs might be controversial, their rise isn’t. As the world rapidly moves on to digitization, more people will realize that NFTs are not a flip-model market that favours only the lucky. NFTs reward creators and collectors alike. Admittedly, a lot still needs to be addressed regarding policies and climate concerns, but it is not hard to see long-term solutions as we keep moving. If anything, the needs currently being met by NFTs are only precursors to more fields being transformed positively.\nThankfully, AirNFTs allows everyone to get on the NFT train easily. You can tokenize your creative works for less than a dollar. Visit the page to get started.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "After the successful NFT launchpad program was organized on the platform, we have been listening to the community demand about a possible burn program.\nSimultaneously, the AirNFTs team has been at work planning the most value-adding burn schedule for our beloved AIRT community.\nWhat\u0027s a Token Burn?\nFor starters let\u0027s explain what a token burn actually means. A token burn is a process of sending a number of tokens to a wallet address   where the private keys are unobtainable by anyone. This process makes the tokens unusable forever and cannot be undone.\nThe end goal is to reduce the token total supply and thus making it more valuable for the holders.\nWhy Do Projects Do Token Burn?\nToken burns will keep the token value at a healthy level and importantly embrace the importance of scarcity as the supply of the tokens in circulation is intentionally decreased.\nThis process adds confidence for the community of token holders as the tokens they hold become more and more scarce and thus valuable.\nAIRT Token Burn Schedule\nThe AIRT burn schedule will be a bi-weekly period burn where a portion of the unsold launchpad tokens is burned and sent to a burn address. Unlike other projects we have a top cap so we will never mint new AIRT tokens, the burnt tokens will unobtainable forever and thus this reduces the total supply indefinitely.\nEvery 2 weeks, we will be burning 10m AIRT, and thus reduce periodically the total supply of the AIRT tokens, until the entirety of the unsold 114m AIRT is fully burned (Which is closer to 15% of the token total supply)\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

And for this special occasion, we wanted to announce the AirNFTs public raise as the first NFT launchpad ever organized.\nOur users will have the opportunity to purchase these launchpad NFTs that will be converted into AIRT tokens at the end of the program.\nWe have allocated 20% of the total supply for the public launchpad program. From day one, we have always wanted to be a community-first funded project, where our users are the most significant holders and would have a word in the future direction of the project.\nSince the project has never sold any tokens to private investors, we decided the best way to kick start a fundraiser was to make sure our users have the same opportunities that private investors would otherwise have.\nWhat is the NFT launchpad?\nLike IFO (initial farm offering), projects and artists can raise funds through NFTs with symbolic token value, this particular type of fundraising is called the NFT launchpad. The purchased NFTs are later minted to the users and the tokens are transferred to the user\u0027s addresses, respective to the purchase they made during the launchpad.\nHow to participate?\nGet started in 3 simple steps:\nAt the end of the launchpad, we shall distribute all AIRT allocation to the buyers with respect to the amount they purchased. The participants can also sell their launchpad NFTs on the secondary market.\nAs you might have known, the project has been run solely from founders\u0027 resources from day one. We have never taken any form of outside investments and we have never sold any token to private investors.\nAs we plan to scale up the project further and execute the most ambitious goals and boost development to reach our roadmap goals faster, we need to raise funds to sustain these objectives for the long term.\nVisit NFT launchpad\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

Summer is here, grab a cold drink and check out this month\u0027s selection.\nAlexandra Crisan‍‍\nTell us something about you.\nMy name is Alexandra Crișan. I\u0027m an architect, an interior designer and a dreamer at heart, with an avid desire to change things and make it better. I\u0027ve always felt that any form of good design can make a significant difference in people\u0027s lives and contribute to a better world.\nWhere are you from?\nBucharest, Romania\nWhen did you start making art?\nI\u0027ve been painting and drawing since I was little and I\u0027ve pursued my passion through art school and then architecture school, graduating with an MD. I have a tremendous love and curiosity for all forms of artistic expression. My strong interest in all forms of art allowed me to go from sketches to 3D models and then mould all of my ideas into more tangible forms like buildings, interiors, and furniture. Recently, I\u0027ve resumed my exploration of painting as a more liberated means of expressing myself, experimenting with acrylics, oil paint, and watercolor, as well as the unlimited possibilities of combining all of this into a digital form.\nWhat motivates you?\nCreativity, curiosity and stories. Stories have always picked people\u0027s attention because they create a sense of hope and creativity that gives you wings and allows you to figuratively express all of your emotions. Curiosity may instill in you a sense of wonder that you can always share with others. A combination of these three always keeps me motivated.\nWhat is your favorite piece you created? Why? Tell us something about it.\nGoddess of the sea is my personal favourite. I\u0027ve always been fascinated by water and imagined what it might be like to live beneath it, in a magical setting, surrounded by all of its unseen splendors.\nWhich software do you use?\nMostly Photoshop, as well as hand-painted acrylics or watercolor on canvas as a first layer and occasionally 3d softwares,\nPersonal achievements.\nHaving utilised art to improve people\u0027s living environments all around the world , as well as using time and kindness where art was insufficient for a change.\nYour AirNFT profile link.\nAirNFTs Profile Link\nSocial link/website.\nInstagram‍\nWhere are you from?\nJORDAN\nWhen did you start making art?\nI have been creating art since my childhood as I come from a creative family who is already in the art scene.\nWhat motivates you?\nI started photography 6 years ago and I was able to capture some really nice moments with my lens, but I always saw a story behind each raw image I captured, which might not be transferred clearly to the viewer. That’s why I decided to add the art factor in terms of graphics and editing to those images. That’s how I was able to create a scene and a feeling that gives a new perspective to the viewer, but also the story of that image.\nWhat is your favorite piece you created?\nThe End of ETHEREUM MINING, the coming of ETH 2.0\nWhy? Tell us something about it:\nThat was a picture I took 6 years ago in Berlin of an old man doing some metal work. I always loved that picture. I have it hanging on the wall, meanwhile I started mining eth just a while ago. And the fact that the ETH mining is coming to an end very soon, and the idea that I need to mine as fast as possible with the limited resources I have. It is a representation of the old man trying to mine as fast as possible with his limited physical power...with the ETH 2.0 just behind him coming to get him\nWhich software do you use?\nI mainly use my own raw images, edit them on photoshop, then add some graphics using Adobe photoshop and after effects mainly\nPersonal achievements:\nWhen it comes to photography I was able to gain some recognition in the region (UAE and Jordan) through some known digital newspaper\nYour AirNFT profile link:\nAirNFTs Profile Link\nSocial link/website.\nInstagram\n‍\nWhere are you from?\nI live in the city of Dnipro. Ukraine.\nTell us something about you.\nRecently, I started selling digital art for cryptocurrency on various platforms. I am a graphics and 3D motion designer. Initially, I was engaged in fashion photography as well as shooting short films and music videos. Currently, I plan to start shooting again. But I\u0027m relatively new in the 3D world. Let\u0027s just say that NFT has become one of the motivations to take up 3D again. My skills are still developing, but every day I get better at what I do.\nWhat motivates you?\nMotivation is a tricky thing. Sometimes it may just not be there. But the most motivating thing for me is that I am a creator, and I recreate what I imagine, for which I am generously rewarded. What could be better than your favorite business, which not only gives you the opportunity to realize yourself, but is also commercially successful?\nWhat is your favorite piece you created? Tell us something about it:\nOn one of the sites, I launched a collection called Dreamcars. I love cars. For their design, ride comfort in them. They are an integral part of our life, cinema, whatever. A car is one of the few inanimate things that can say almost everything about a person. What is a person\u0027s lifestyle? Interests. And the most important thing is how free and successful he is. How much gasoline does the car use, how fast it is or how big it is.\nI think the most suitable artwork would be one of my last works: DREAMCARS\nWhich software do you use?\nI mainly work in Blender. Post-processing is done in After Effects / Photoshop.\nPersonal achievements:\nAs for personal achievements, there is a great demand for the Dreamcars collection on the AirNFTs marketplace.\nYour AirNFT profile link:\nAirNFTs Profile Link\nSocial link/website.\nTwitter\nInstagram\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "\nAnother month has passed on the vast ocean of the NFT’s. The crypto world went through several storms indeed, but thanks to the creativity and dedication that blew our veils, we’ve successfully continued the journey among talented artists. Check out this month\u0027s top 3 artists!\nCashewJUAN\nI am a volatile mix of architect and artist, 28 years of age. Also part of the generation of kids with limited internet connection, dial phones and a lot of outside playing. Also an adult in a tech world growing so fast I can’t even fully comprehend it.\nMy work always starts physically, with paintbrushes, painting knives and canvases, after that comes the digital twists, where I take the artwork where It can never go in the physical world. Everything I post was once painted on a canvas.\nIonuț Cășuneanu\nBucharest, Romania\nFirst start was in Art Highschool, but the real start was almost 2 years ago when I decided to stop conventional painting and really started to express myself. Self-expression is overrated but beneficial for self-harmony. In my opinion, it’s the perfect shield in the new era world.\nI can’t say exactly, it\u0027s very hard to find motivation in these “everything is a distraction” times. Just taking it step by step, learning, making mistakes and going forward as much as I can. Unlike blockchain which is unstoppable, I am human and have limitations. But the great thing about limitations is that when embracing them, you can create this thing called “art”.\n*CONTRACURENT* Why? Because it’s awesome. And because it was the first painting that surprised me when creating it. The physical painting technique I use is highly unstable and results can sometimes dramatically differ (unlike the digital processing where everything can be 100% controlled). After that, the *Digital dreamcatchers* collection (posted on my airNFT’s profile) was born.\n\nFirst and foremost, I use real acrylic paints laced with all sorts of mediums. After I take multiple photographs, the digitalization is made using mostly Adobe Photoshop and GlitchLab.\nSelling my first artwork in real-life, selling my first NFT on airNFT’s. Being both an analog and digital creator, they are both huge milestones in my life and artistic path.\nCashewJuan AirNFTs Profile Link\nInstagram‍\nSkiwolker\n\nI am Daniele Di Donato also known as Skiwolker. I am a 3D artist from Italy. I work in a video production company and in my spare time I am an artist.\nI am from Italy.\nIt all started back in 2017. I had a lot of interest in 3D art and I really liked the artworks that many artists were publishing on Instagram. So I started to make artwork every day. At first, I did not have knowledge of software and of composition, I learned all those things by experience. I also had different artistic styles during these years because I wanted to discover new techniques and have fun.\nI simply love 3D graphics. It allows me to create everything that I have in mind. I love to create surreal environments, something that is between realism and imagination. All the artworks that I have made are pieces of me, they store all my feelings and ideas. Sometimes I am inspired by other artists’ artworks, where I can find new ideas and the drive to do better.\nIt is hard to choose only one, but I think “Shelter” will be a good answer. I love the general mood of this piece, the lighting and the fact that it is one of my last artworks with a ghost as a subject.\nI was inspired by “Midsommar”, one of my favorite movies. If you have watched it, you can recognize the building where the ghost is staring (even if it is a bit different) and what it means. You can also understand why I have called this artwork “Shelter\n‍\nI usually use C4D and Octane Render. Sometimes I use Blender too.\nI have made various album covers and music videos for different artists and sold a few NFTs on AirNFTs and other platforms.\nSkiwolker AirNFTs Profile Link\nYou can find all my social links on my website:\nwww.skiwolker.com\nSkywent\nHi, my name is Bogdan Skitenko, but I prefer to use the pseudonym Skywent. I\u0027m a 2D\u00263D Illustrator as well as a motion designer from Ukraine. I like to experiment with digital art, and I\u0027m searching for my unique visual style. My main goal is that when people see my work, they experience an emotional response, and they say \"Damn, this is really cool! Now I want to do something cool!\"\nWhere are you from?\nI am from Ukraine\nI started to create art when I was 14 years old. Then I got acquainted with the game Garry\u0027s mod, in short, it\u0027s a sandbox in which you can do whatever you want. The game has a lot of content that allows you to create in addition to the fun scenes of characters and objects. That was the first time I made my own digital art. And that was the first step in the beginning of my interesting creative path.\nCreating a digital art object that can trigger an emotional response. To create something that can interact with the viewer, even without their participation. To put a piece of myself into my art and be happy when my art triggers an emotion. I create for the sake of emotions.\nI have a few favorite pieces. One is \"F#CK THE MONEY\" and the other is a collection of AIRT bills. The work \"F#CK THE MONEY\" has become one of my favorites because it is my personal protest and my vision of one of the pressing issues of many people, including myself. The way I see it, when it comes to their vocation, people wouldn\u0027t care how much money they would get for this or that. People would choose to do what they really like rather than what society demands. As ironic as it may be, my second favorite piece is the AIRT banknote collection. In this collection, I was able to combine all my skills and create something quite appealing, and most importantly, to create an object that interacts with the viewer even without their involvement. The AIRT banknote collection plays by the rules of the AirNFTs site, namely, it is like a visual embodiment of AIRT tokens. The price of the bills is directly related to the number of tokens the buyer will receive. And that\u0027s what I call interaction with the viewer.\n‍\nI mostly use Blender + Adobe Photoshop, and sometimes Adobe Premiere Pro to create my work.\nAs a personal achievement, I can only emphasize the fact that if I had the opportunity to go back in time to fix something, I would not fix anything at all.\nSkywent AirNFTs Profile Link\nSocial link/website.\nInstagram\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

We want the community to drive the future of AirNFTs as it reaches critical mass adoption\nWe believe that in the near future companies would not even need to have even public founders as long as everything is done in the best interests of the community – one of the good examples would be Bitcoin, no public face, no CEO and it has been running for the past few years relatively well.\nSo far we\u0027ve been able to build the product, the community, broke even financially before raising any outside funds, we have never shilled any token or pushing users to buy platform tokens.\nMatter of fact we reached the threshold of 500K users, 5M$ in sales gross volume during the first month by running entirely without any raised funds and without selling tokens to users.\nFrom the core, we are product builders, we don\u0027t want to be any sort of crypto famous, we prefer to keep our profile low and focus on building what actually matters to our users and the community in general.\nBeing pseudo-anonymous might have drawbacks, mostly because people usually don\u0027t have trust in organizations without public faces, but we believed by running the organization in the best interest of our community we would be able to build the trust factor, that explains why our early adopters adore our products and love everything about it.\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

There are two variants: BEP 2 and BEP20 (or Smart chain).\nBNB or BEP2 was initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain in 2017 but later moved to Binance blockchain (or Binance Chain) to serve as the utility token.\nWhat is Binance Smart Chain?\nSmart Chain is basically BNB for Binance Smart Chain. Same price, same owner but more functionalities —  fuelling smart contracts.\nThe Smart Chain variant was created last September and is required to run all transactions on Binance Smart Chain- the smart parallel to blockchain. Just like you need Ether as a fuel for Ethereum-based DApps, you need the Smart Chain gas on Binance Smart Chain. It enables you interact with BSC-powered DApps including AirNFTs.\nWhere to get BNB\n3. Moonpay\nNote that you’ll have to transfer the BNB to your Trust wallet after making the purchase to enable you work with DApp on the Trust wallet DApp browser.\nHow to swap your BNB to the Smart Chain?\nAs said earlier, Smart Chain is the BEP20 variant that works with smart contract-enabled DApps on Binance Smart Chain.\n1. Click on BNB on your Trust wallet,\n2. Select Swap to Smart Chain,\n3. Type in the amount you want and click on Swap.\nNote that you’ll pay a meager network fee - typically less than $2.\nEnter the app.airnfts.com in the DApp browser.

    "content": "1. Transparency for verified smartcontract code\nAirNFTs being a marketplace for exploring, buying, selling, and collecting digital arts and collectibles, its main source of revenue comes from the 2.5% commission rate on sales effectuated on the platform.\nThe logic behind the commission fee can be seen directly from our contract code deployed and verified on the BSC scan.\nHere are the major steps that happen when you click the \"Buy\" button on a certain NFT page :\nWhen a sale happens, the sale funds are sent to the seller as an internal transaction, this means that the sale happens via contract code execution. The current reality is that most wallet apps out there are not able to track internal transactions. The actual sale funds do still reach the seller wallet and the balance is updated afterward.\nYou can read more about internal transactions not showing on the links below :\nIn brief how do you know you actually got money for a sale? When you don\u0027t see the transaction in your wallet after a sale, this only means most wallets don\u0027t support NFT sale transactions yet, the balance still gets updated despite the wallet app not showing the transaction.\nIn this article, we covered how AirNFTs execute transactions, we took some time to explain the common confusion cases that happen when transactions don\u0027t show up after-sales.\nAt the end of the day, there\u0027s no need to worry, your NFTs and your funds are SAFU at AirNFTs, have fun minting and collecting, buying and reselling your NFTs.\nYours AirNFTs Team.\n‍\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "We worked tirelessly for the launch of our platform a little over a month ago, but all our efforts have been well rewarded by the vast number of users, both artists and buyers.\nThis level of engagement from the community motivated us to burn the midnight oil (work overtime) and earn our place among the best crypto art apps on the market.\nTo further highlight some the amazing art currently on our platform, we’re starting a monthly best picks top.\nHere is April’s Best Picks:\nMy real name is Pedro Gomes, and I go by the name Pedraw . I am a visual artist based in London, I am focused on creating bold and colorful artworks that represent the characters that live in my imagination.\nIm was born in Portugal and I have Angolan descent.\nSince I was 15. I stopped drawing when I was 18 years old for around 4 years. Later in life, I was studying Graphic Design and Animation at the University of Westminster. Since then I never stopped making art.\nMostly ancient technology, I am also a huge fan of old-school graphic design and I am very passionate about colors. I also enjoy learning while making art and the sense of discovery that goes with it.\nIt’s called Nuntius. The artwork is a visual representation of a Devine being sharing knowledge by offering a Tech device shaped like a pyramid.\nMostly Adobe Photoshop.\nI was featured in a few magazines such as Advanced Photoshop, and participated in an award-wining campaign recently.\nPedro Gomes AirNFTs profile link\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pedraw\n‍\nHi! So, my fans know me under the name of Cute Characters so let’s stick with that and be a bit mysterious! A lot of people think I\u0027m a male, but I\u0027m going to surprise you, I\u0027m not. In addition to drawing illustrations, I am also a student but not in the field of art. Art isn\u0027t a job for me but more passion that gives a reason to be happy. I look forward to creating new art every time and it is also a great way to escape to a different world, that teaches me to dream and think beyond.\nI started drawing when I was small. I would copy illustrations from my favorite movies and I would still be creating something. About a year ago, I discovered the magic of digital illustrations. It was hard to get used to the screen instead of paper, but in the end, it completely changed the way I was making art. I\u0027ve always admired the artists who create 3D art. I wanted to do something similar, so I created my first Cute Character – Frida. I\u0027ve been creating Cute Characters ever since. I enjoy how creative you can be in creating different characters.\nThe motivation for me is above all that I really enjoy making art, I will not lie there are some days when it\u0027s hard and I do have a creative block. Then it always makes me happy when someone likes my characters and especially the fact that people buy them and are happy about it!\nMy favorite piece must be Frida. It has a certain meaning for me, mainly because it was my first character and I learned a lot of things from it. But also because Frida Kahlo has always been a symbol of a strong woman for me.\nEveryone is always very surprised when I say that I work with Procreate. I am glad that people think I\u0027m creating my characters in 3D software, but that\u0027s not the case. All my characters are hand-drawn in Procreate.\nI would like to constantly improve, not only personally but also improve my art. There is always room for improvement and I like to learn new things. I would like my characters to make people happy and to keep the family of Cute Characters growing!\nCute_Characters AirNFT profile link\nYou can also find me on Twitter @cute_characters\n\nMy name is BoMo, I am a motion and broadcast designer from Moscow, Russia. I have been in the industry for a long time, but 3 months ago I started doing crypto art!\nI am inspired by the opportunity to tell a story and be heard.\nThe \"BlackDolls\" project is an allegory of society. as I see it. I have a whole story about the \"Blackdolls\", their religion, politics and culture. The \"Mask\" project is part of the BlackDoll project.\nMy working tools Cinema 4D, Redshift, After Effects.\nMy personal achievements are ahead.\nI am the official representative of the artist Melba Marat (@melba_marat) Concept-artist of the children\u0027s animated series of the \"Soyuzmultfilm\" studio. I present her works \"Nymphs\" and \"Dolls\". \"Nymphs\" is a project that embodies feminine beauty. \"Dolls\" is a frank project. Behind the bright colors is a story that tells about the fragility of the human body and the transience of life. There are a lot of interesting projects ahead!\nBomo AirNFT profile link\nTwitter: @bolotovmotion‍\nFollow us on\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",

    "content": "The NFT boom is upon the crypto space, with several NFTs selling for millions. While your tokenized pieces may not sell for that much, the good news is that you can potentially make some money too, by applying the right strategies. Learn how to sell your photography, music, art, videos and game items as an NFTs for your chosen price.\nBut first, what makes for good digital artwork?\nAlthough art is purely subjective, there is a prime quality that makes for a good piece — originality. Your digital artwork must be unique. You cannot pass off someone else’s work as yours while hoping to profit from it.\nSo you have your original NFT, now what?\nYour creativity doesn’t just end at the click of “create” on any NFT marketplace. To make worthwhile returns on your work, there are important tips you must be aware of, and this is what we’ll be talking about in this short guide.\nIn any economic model, scarcity drives demand up. Creating artificial scarcity increases the perceived value of your works, and there are two ways to do this:\nLimit the supply: For any artwork series, ensure to cap the supply from the outset.\nCreate rarity tiers: Unless you are new in the NFT space, you’ll have seen numerous NFT artists group their pieces into different tiers based on their limited supply. While some use terms like common, rare, super rare, and legendary, others get a little more creative with tiers like Common, epic, unique, legendary. Of course, the artworks become more valuable as you go up the rarity scale.\nThe key is to get creative with your artwork series. Whenever possible, cap the supply and split into tiers.\nHopping around several marketplaces to mint and sell rarely makes for a profitable experience. Establishing your works on an ideal marketplace where you can create at the cheapest cost and sell at your choice price is always a good idea. Thankfully, AirNFTs provide just that on Binance Smart Chain. What’s more, later up by integrating the Ethereum 2.0 by the time it gets launched. Making it a mega cross-chain hub for all tokenized artworks.\nAfter securing your brand with an ideal marketplace, the next thing is to increase your reach via social media. Promote your artworks on Twitter and Instagram using trending hashtags such as #nfts, #nftcollectors, #nftmarketplaces, etc. Join Telegram and Discord groups with NFTs as their prime focus. LinkedIn isn’t just for professionals; you can promote your works there as well. Doing all of these ultimately increases your visibility, consequently increasing your chance of selling your works at your desired price.\nYou have already made the right decision by choosing us as your mainstay NFT marketplace. Go one step further by joining our active Telegram and Twitter communities. There, you will meet like-minded artists and collectors to share ideas and potentially make gainful trades.\nUnderstand that value is perceived and how you present your work plays a big role in what becomes of it. Collectors largely invest in not only artworks, but also the artists. Develop a personal brand, create unique themes, and be original. Do all of these and watch collectors rally round your work.\nYou can also use this template to make your NFTs look branded and professional to share them on twitter or instagram\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain.

    "content": "The idea of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is not new and has been around for quite some time, but it only grew in popularity as cryptocurrencies became more mainstream. NFTs and cryptocurrencies both work on an underlying tech—blockchain, and other than what they represent, there are important distinctions between them. Here’s a short explainer on what an NFT is.\nWhat is an NFT?\nAn NFT is a digital token that uniquely represents an object (physical or otherwise) on the blockchain. NFTs can represent a variety of things: physical objects like artworks, properties, trophies, digital content, or even intangible concepts like intellectual property.\nNon-fungible tokens, in contrast to cryptocurrencies, are non-fungible. Unlike in other money markets where one dollar for example, can be exchanged for another with no disproportion, no two NFTs have equal value. It might be helpful to think of NFTs like a birth certificate for example—it is unique and one of a kind, it\u0027s proof that it\u0027s you, and Ii cannot be replaced with anything else. The same way you cannot exchange your birth certificate with another person’s, NFTs carry unique values that can not be exchanged.\nHow are NFTs valued?\nHaving understood what NFTs are, you might ask why would anyone pay $5000 for a piece of art, especially when they can just download it in one click. Yes, they can have it, but they don’t own it. NFTs provide digital provenance, all verifiable on the blockchain. So you might have downloaded one, but you do not own it, everyone can see the owner.\nThat said, like any other financial asset, value is often perceived. The value of an NFT is based on the value that buyers give it. The fiat you have in your wallet has value because everyone agrees it does, otherwise it would just be a piece of paper. If the NFT is well received by the audience it is being sold to, the value will go up.\nFor instance, if you own an Aston Martin that once was owned by James Bond, you have something valuable because everyone knows 007, but in the actual sense, you can get the same model anywhere else. That is why CryptoPunks and NBA Top Shot have this immense value, and to be realistic, we all have soft spots for a few things that might seem odd to others.\nShort answer: yes. Outrageous evaluations will settle down, but these unique digital assets are not going anywhere. NFTs are not limited to digital art; they have several use cases such as gaming, collectibles, virtual worlds and metaverse, music and a gazillion other utilities that we probably don’t even know yet. You can get on the train early and start creating your NFTs today.\nYou can buy NFT on AirNFTs explore page, or you can create your own NFT on BSC and start selling and earning crypto for NFTs today.\nFollow us on\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. It is a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or videos.\nNFTs work by creating a unique digital signature on a blockchain network that verifies ownership of the underlying digital asset. This means that the original creator of the digital asset can sell it as an NFT and the buyer will have proof of ownership that is publicly recorded on the blockchain.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its scarcity and uniqueness. Since NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, they can be highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts who want to own a piece of digital art, music or video that cannot be replicated.\nCreating an NFT requires some technical knowledge and involves uploading your digital asset to a blockchain network and minting it as an NFT. Buying an NFT can be done through various NFT marketplaces such as AirNFTs, where buyers can bid on or purchase NFTs using cryptocurrency.\nInvesting in NFTs can be risky, as the value of an NFT can fluctuate depending on market demand and the reputation of the creator. Additionally, since NFTs are a relatively new technology, there may be uncertainties regarding their long-term value and legal status.\nNFT Marketplace on BSC, ETH, FTM and Matic\ninfo@airnfts.com\n",
