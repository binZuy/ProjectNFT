Following the announcement, there has been a noticeable increase in the value of his previous NFTs. Launch of the ‚ÄòMugshot Edition‚Äô NFT Collection The new collection offers various incentives to purchasers. Buyers of 47 of the new Trump NFTs will receive rewards such as a dinner with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, as well as a piece of the suit that Trump wore for his mugshot, accompanied by a signed physical card. Some cards within the collection will be one-of-ones, which means they are unique editions. In addition, others may be hand-signed by Donald J. Trump himself. Trump announcing that if you buy all 47 of his new ‚ÄòMug Shot Edition‚Äô digital cards for $4,653, you will get an autographed piece of the suit he wore when he was arrested. pic.twitter.com/zpuoYCF6dS ‚Äî Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) December 12, 2023 Since the end of his presidency, Trump‚Äôs interest in NFTs and cryptocurrency has been on the rise, leading to an increase in profits from these ventures. Trump has already released multiple NFT collections, featuring digital collectible cards with sporting images that resemble traditional baseball cards. His last collection proved to be highly popular, selling out immediately upon its release. Market Reaction As of August, it has been noted that Trump‚Äôs crypto wallet had accumulated over $2.8 million from NFT sales. The release of this new collection comes at an intriguing time, considering Trump‚Äôs legal challenges and ongoing re-election campaign. His active engagement with cryptocurrency and the digital economy may position him as a potentially forward-thinking president in this area, should he be re-elected. Notably, previous NFT collections from Trump initially sold at a reduced rate of 0.1 ETH, which is a 50% decrease from the original price. However, following the recent announcement of the new ‚ÄúMugshot edition‚Äù collection, the prices of these earlier releases have rebounded to over 0.18 ETH. Blending Politics with Digital Innovation The introduction of Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMugshot edition‚Äù NFT collection not only marks a significant step in the former president‚Äôs continued foray into the digital asset space but also reflects a broader trend of political figures engaging with emerging technologies. The collection‚Äôs unique incentives, including dinners and exclusive memorabilia, demonstrate an innovative approach to leveraging NFTs for both personal branding and political campaigning. This strategic move, amidst his ongoing legal challenges and re-election campaign, suggests a potential shift in how political figures might utilize digital assets and cryptocurrency in the future. Moreover, the rebound in value of his previous NFT collections following this announcement underscores the impact high-profile personalities can have on the NFT market. This trend highlights the evolving intersection of politics, technology, and digital economy, potentially paving the way for a new era of political engagement and fundraising strategies.

If one were to assess an online casino website from 2012, one would be surprised at how different it is from modern-day platforms. Not only are online gambling spaces full of advanced features and hundreds of games, but they also deliver a seamless and safe experience for users. People who sign up at gambling sites no longer have to worry that their information is in danger. Another area where online casinos are improving is their payment options for adding and withdrawing money. Many casinos are now offering cryptocurrency payments, while a few establishments are ‚Äúcrypto only‚Äù in 2022. Below is an explanation of why crypto casinos are emerging at such a rapid pace in 2022 and why they are likely to grab a larger market share in 2023. Source: Unsplash 1. Privacy People who enthusiastically sign up for online casino sites and then play games or bet on sports matches are extremely privacy-conscious. No one wants their online gambling habits being used against them by a hacker or some other nefarious actor. An issue with regular online casinos is that you often have to use a bank account or credit card to add and withdraw money. That means there is a link to your real identity, which could compromise your personal or financial security if there is ever a hack of the casino‚Äôs database. Even though online casino sites take great steps to avoid such issues happening, no website is infallible. That is why any privacy-conscious person sees a crypto casino as superior in 2022 and beyond. 2. Improved Security Aside from having complete privacy when you are signing up for an online casino, adding money, placing bets, and withdrawing your winnings, you can also benefit in other ways from using a crypto casino. These platforms often have better security against the games being hacked or any bias being present in the algorithm that decides what numbers emerge during a game. Crypto casinos often feature RNG software to ensure that all numbers churned out by the system during games, poker, blackjack, or roulette are 100 percent random. These casinos also give out unique codes to gamblers, which ensures that only people with access can enter games and use the platform. Source: Unsplash 3. Prompt Transactions Anyone who has ever tried to withdraw money from a standard online casino can understand the frustration of payment delays. There are often waiting times of anywhere from 2 to 5 business days to process a bank transaction, which is not ideal for most gamblers. By signing up at a crypto casino, betters can ensure they are cashing out their winnings within minutes and receiving that money as bitcoins or another cryptocurrency within hours. They can then convert that cryptocurrency into US dollars or any other currency. In addition, there are no fees or commissions when you are adding and withdrawing money using crypto. Bank accounts and credit cards often have transaction fees, especially if you are paying money to an institution not based in your home country. 4. Play Competitors From Around the World A downside to online casinos that rely on bank accounts and credit cards to process transactions is that they are often limited by geography. A casino may have a license to operate in the United States but cannot accept customers from the UK as the relevant payment transactions will not be processed. Such an issue is not present when you are using cryptocurrency to add and withdraw money from the casino. People from around the world can play, regardless of their citizenship or present residence. All they need is access to cryptocurrency and the online casino platform on their computer or mobile device. Source: Unsplash Bet Safely Using a Reputable Platform Whether you are playing poker, blackjack, roulette, or another casino game or betting on sports matches, you must do so using a reputable platform. Ensure that you read customer reviews of any website or mobile app before you sign up and add money to your account. The best platforms offer you the chance to add money to your account using Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies. You can also withdraw your winnings using crypto, ensuring you do not need to provide the casino with any personal information that could be used to identify you.

Built on Axelar, Squid will enable cross-chain transactions for NFT purchases. When you select to buy an NFT with an alternate asset in your wallet from a Decentraland-compatible chain (like Ethereum or Polygon), Squid efficiently processes your order behind the scenes. The transaction converts your chosen asset to $MANA and then finalizes your NFT acquisition within approximately 20 seconds. Shopping in the Marketplace is now even more accessible. üõçÔ∏è Announcing our new partnership with @squidrouter and @axelarnetwork enabling multi-chain purchasing. https://t.co/F6mlmo5Cj8 ‚Äî Decentraland (@decentraland) December 6, 2023 A Strategic Move for Ecosystem Growth The main objective behind this initiative is to enhance interoperability and accessibility across Decentraland‚Äôs ecosystem. This move is set to benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including content creators, players, and contributors, by simplifying interactions within the digital space. Despite integrating various tokens, the utility of Decentraland‚Äôs native token, $MANA, remains integral. The approach of interoperability is not to sideline $MANA but to complement it, allowing users to leverage their native holdings alongside other tokens in the marketplace. The Mechanics of Squid‚Äôs Integration Squid‚Äôs approach to this integration is based on a straightforward principle: it will route orders across chains in the background once a user executes a request to purchase an NFT. Squid estimates the completion time for this process to be around 20 seconds, marking a notable advancement in transaction efficiency. Source Squid For users looking to utilize this new feature, the process begins with connecting their wallets to Decentraland. Once connected, they can navigate to the ‚ÄòCollectibles‚Äô tab. A notable change here is introducing a ‚Äòbuy with crypto‚Äô button, replacing the previous‚Äô buy with $MANA‚Äô option. This includes the flexibility to switch to different networks per the user‚Äôs preference. Upon completing the transaction, the purchased NFT will automatically be added to the user‚Äôs ‚Äòwardrobe‚Äô. This enhancement in Decentraland‚Äôs platform closely follows Squid‚Äôs recent launch of the Squid NFT Checkout feature, which aims to simplify the NFT purchase process by exploiting the cross-chain functionality. With the introduction of NFT Checkout, Squid addresses and eliminates the common limitations users face in the NFT marketplace. These limitations often include restrictions on purchasing NFTs with select tokens and specific chains, which can hinder accessibility. Squid‚Äôs solution removes these constraints, offering a more inclusive and flexible buying experience.

The funding will be used to support TinyTap‚Äôs business expansion and accelerate development in the edtech space. The investment will enable TinyTap to continue to expand its successful Web2 platform, which already serves over 9.2 million registered members, into an alternative Web3 education system that better values teachers by improving the earning opportunities available to them, and enables parents and communities to support and promote their preferred educational materials. TinyTap launched its Web3 strategy in 2022 with two successful auctions of Publisher NFTs, which generated 243 ETH (approximately US$352,000 at times of auction). Publisher NFTs are a new concept introduced by TinyTap to better empower, reward, and incentivize educational content creators and publishers. Each Publisher NFT represents co-publishing rights to one TinyTap Course, which is a curated bundle of educational games made on the TinyTap platform by one teacher in one specific subject. When these NFTs are sold, the proceeds are shared with the Course creators, and the NFT buyers assume the role of co-publishers. In return for promoting and marketing the associated Courses, the buyers share in the benefits generated from co-publishing efforts. Since the TinyTap Publisher NFTs were auctioned in Q4 2022, the average income to NFT buyers resulting from their co-publishing efforts amounted to approximately 8.2% (or 19.7% annualized) of the purchase price of the Publisher NFTs*. The Publisher NFT model is therefore able to simultaneously benefit the creators of educational content, the buyers of the Publisher NFTs, and TinyTap. This frees the creators to focus their efforts on generation of quality content, while TinyTap and the buyers of Publisher NFTs distribute and promote the content. Misa Matsuzaki owns two Publisher NFTs and earned about $7,823 from November 2022 to March 2024 by co-publishing the associated courses. She commented: ‚ÄúTinyTap helps teachers to actualize great ideas into educational content that can be accessed regardless of location ‚Äì for example, one of the courses I bought was adapted for Japan. I did the first translation and voice over myself with the help of the TinyTap team. I look forward to seeing how Japan will welcome these exciting new possibilities in education! I would like to see more use cases like TinyTap Publisher NFTs, which are so much more interesting than just having NFTs sitting in our wallet!‚Äú Yogev Shelly, CEO of TinyTap, commented: ‚ÄúOur Publisher NFTs genesis auctions demonstrated that the Web3 community is well suited and willing to support educators and educational content via this new powerful and equitable incentive system. By pairing educational content creators with interested promoters, we are able to benefit all parties fairly and take a significant step in our goal to put the power of learning back in the hands of educators, students, and the community.‚Äù Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, commented: ‚ÄúTeachers and educators are among the most important content creators and contributors in society, and yet their wages typically do not reflect their critical importance. This is why we‚Äôre incredibly excited at the Web3 opportunities that TinyTap is exploring in the field of education. Having already succeeded in building a Web2 education platform, TinyTap is now supercharging its efforts using NFTs, making it possible for educators to better generate equity from their work and link up with co-publishers who can handle the promotion of their courses, all while offering students enhanced learning materials.‚Äù Follow TinyTap on Twitter to keep updated on future developments or visit the Web3 landing page to learn more. * Based on the courses‚Äô earnings from the time the associated NFTs were purchased; does not take into consideration seasonal variations in the courses‚Äô performance. Calculation represents an average of 5 months income of the co-publishers for 12 courses. For ease of comparison, earnings for courses that were purchased in December 2022 have been normalized to 5 months. About TinyTap TinyTap, a subsidiary of Animoca Brands, was founded in 2012 and is the world‚Äôs largest educational games library with more than 250,000 activities made by educators and publishers including Sesame Street and Oxford University Press. Games are created using TinyTap‚Äôs code-free authoring platform and can be accessed by parents as part of TinyTap‚Äôs subscription or sold directly to families as bundles. A portion of subscription revenue is shared with content creators based on the user engagement generated by their content. TinyTap is among the top 10 grossing kids apps worldwide, delivering educational content to families in the US, Canada, Europe, and the Arab world with a focus on young learners (Pre-K to Grade 6), serving 9.2 million registered family members with content created by over 100,000 creators.

The biggest web3 gaming event returns on 14 December 2023 for the second year with games going head to head for bragging rights and a prize pool of over $2M, to set the scene for 2024. GAM3S.GG are bringing back the ‚Äúoscars of web3 gaming‚Äù presented in partnership with Magic Eden this year, as 70+ traditional and web3 gaming experts come together to decide the leading games in this space; with the event sponsored by AD Gaming. Initially, 214 nominated games were put in front of 70+ jury members to help produce the preliminary list of nominees. Based on gameplay, mechanics, replayability potential, ‚Äúfun‚Äù factor, accessibility and overall quality ‚Äì 40 shortlisted games have made it onto the next round which opens up for community voting today, November the 22nd. In comparison, the 2022 awards saw 106 nominees in its inaugural edition, with the number of qualified games with playable versions more than doubled ‚Äì reflecting the tremendous growth of web3 gaming throughout the past year. The 40 shortlisted games spanned 9 blockchain networks, with Arbitrum making an awards debut this year with 4 shortlisted finalists. The top five networks represented in the final shortlists are Polygon, Ethereum, Immutable X, Arbitrum and Avalanche. Bringing together industry leaders from both traditional and blockchain gaming allows the awards to maintain a balanced sense of expectation, caution and excitement. This year the jury consists of executives and leaders from Amazon, Google, Ubisoft, Microsoft, and Samsung, in addition to web3 gaming ecosystems, VCs, media outlets and content creators. This year‚Äôs prize pool for the winning games exceeds $2M+ and ranges from cash grants, tech service credits, marketing support, sponsored tournaments, infrastructure support, cloud gaming functionality, and much more from a wide range of partners including Amazon, Magic Eden, AD Gaming, Ultra, Blockchain Gaming Alliance, Naavik, Aethir, and Horizon among others. The 40 finalists are advancing to the second phase of the GAM3 Awards, where the decision-making process involves both jury members and public voting. In this phase, the jury‚Äôs votes has a 90% influence, while community votes will account for the remaining 10%, effectively giving the public a role akin to having 7 seats on the jury in terms of impact, which could very well act as a tiebreaker or shift the balance in favor of some finalists over others. However, for specific categories such as the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Choice Award‚Äô and ‚ÄòBest Content Creator‚Äô, the outcome relies solely on community votes. Both categories have already amassed over 50K nominations, giving the spotlight to 500+ games and 300+ creators from all over the world as fan favorites. Additionally, the ‚ÄòGames‚Äô Choice Award‚Äô is determined by shortlisted game studios voting for what is essentially, their own version of game of the year. This year, several games stood out to the jury as Big Time, Wildcard, Parallel and Deadrop shared the highest number of nominations with 5 each; followed by Illuvium and MetalCore with 4 nominations each. The final GAM3 Awards livestreamed ceremony is scheduled for December 14th, 2023 to be hosted on Twitch, YouTube and X among other streaming platforms; with gameplay premiers and exclusive premieres trailers already confirmed from Star Atlas, The Unioverse, among other titles. Last year‚Äôs event saw the first public premieres and exclusive footage from several games including Mythic Protocol Riftstorm, Mighty Action Heroes, and NFL Rivals ‚Äì which has since amassed over 3M+ downloads on their mobile game. Lastly, the event is also set to reward community members, voters and viewers for their participation. Magic Eden is set to host an exclusive free mint for voters which provides early access to future mints, gaming raffles and exclusive quests. In addition, community voters and viewers have an opportunity to win rewards from a prize pool worth over $100k USD in prizes ranging from in-game items, early access passes, gaming PCs, gaming consoles and accessories.

Robby told us in an exclusive interview: ‚Äú2023 is going to be remembered as a milestone year, on the one hand because the economic downturn meant that only the most dedicated developers continued building, but on the other hand, because the kinds of games that we‚Äôre seeing launch now are far more polished than the first generation of web3 games.‚Äù Looking at the future of web3 gaming in 2024, Chris Akhavan, Chief Gaming Officer at Magic Eden added: ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to see over 200 web3 games nominated for the GAM3 Awards.

Music NFTs: Powering a New Era in The Music Industry Music NFTs introduce numerous possibilities for artists and their fans. They act as a powerful vehicle, allowing artists to release new music directly to their fan base, bypassing conventional record labels or streaming platforms. On the other hand, fans can back their favorite artists by purchasing virtual items such as concert tickets, merchandise, or even a piece of the artist‚Äôs future success. NFTs also offer an avenue for artists to raise funds for fresh projects or causes close to their hearts. One of the most transformative aspects of music NFTs is their ability to cultivate more rewarding, creative, and intimate communities for artists and fans. This fresh approach democratises the music industry by allowing fans to share ownership of songs and have a tangible stake in an artist‚Äôs success. This shift promises a more interactive relationship between artists and fans, potentially reshaping music production and consumption.

This surge underscores the platform‚Äôs ability to leverage blockchain technology effectively to redefine how music is owned and distributed in the digital age. Sonorus stands at the forefront of the music industry‚Äôs digital transformation, offering a decentralized environment that facilitates direct connections between artists and their fan base. By cutting out intermediaries, the platform empowers musicians to have greater control over their work and directly engage with their audience. Redefining Music Ownership Central to Sonorus‚Äôs success is its utilization of blockchain technology. By employing a decentralized ledger, the platform ensures transparent and immutable records of ownership and transactions. This not only provides artists with greater security and control over their intellectual property but also creates a trust-based environment for all stakeholders involved. With traditional music distribution models facing challenges related to piracy and opaque revenue streams, Sonorus‚Äôs innovative approach addresses these issues head-on. By tokenizing music assets, artists can have a clear and traceable record of ownership, ensuring they receive fair compensation for their creations. Decentralized Connections One of Sonorus‚Äôs key strengths lies in its ability to foster direct connections between artists and their fan base. Through the platform, musicians can engage with their audience on a more personal level, sharing exclusive content, updates, and even organizing virtual events. This direct interaction not only strengthens the artist-fan relationship but also enables fans to play a more active role in supporting their favorite creators. By purchasing and trading music NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), fans can become true stakeholders in the success of the artists they admire. Web3 Solutions in the Music Industry Sonorus‚Äôs rapid growth is indicative of a broader trend within the music industry towards embracing web3 solutions. As the digital landscape evolves, artists and industry professionals are increasingly recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and decentralized platforms to address longstanding challenges. This surge in popularity also underscores the growing appetite among music enthusiasts and creators for innovative, forward-thinking solutions that prioritize transparency, security, and direct engagement. Sonorus‚Äôs remarkable growth, with an influx of 160,000 new users in just six months, is a testament to the platform‚Äôs ability to leverage blockchain technology to redefine music ownership and distribution. By providing a decentralized environment for artists to connect directly with their fan base, Sonorus is at the forefront of reshaping the music industry. This success story reflects a broader industry shift towards web3 solutions, highlighting the increasing demand for innovative, transparent, and artist-centric platforms in the music ecosystem.

The transferred volume includes more than 118 million Ethereum-hosted and over 101 million JumpNet-hosted NFTs. New Features Added With Migration In a move announced this June, Enjin launched its own blockchain, designed explicitly for functions related to NFTs, such as transfers and royalty allocation. The transition to Enjin Blockchain introduces several new features like built-in royalties and ‚ÄúFuel Tanks.‚Äù With ‚ÄúFuel Tanks,‚Äù developers have the option to offset gas fees for their users, potentially reducing the cost of transacting in the ecosystem. Enjin is also planning on facilitating free transactions within its ecosystem over a span of three months. Strategy for Efficient Migration For this large-scale migration, Atlas Development Services, a significant contributor to the Enjin Blockchain, employed a unique strategy to avoid hefty gas fees. Instead of removing Ethereum NFTs and minting new ones on the Enjin Blockchain, a snapshot was utilized. This method provides users an avenue to claim their NFTs on the new blockchain. Users can lay claim to their NFTs on the Enjin Blockchain by signing with their Ethereum wallets, eliminating associated gas fees. This system implies that the original NFTs stay on the Ethereum networks. However, holders are advised to view the NFTs on the Enjin Blockchain as the official ones, marking a noteworthy step in the NFT space. Enjin‚Äôs Strategic Leap Enjin‚Äôs successful migration of over 200 million NFTs from Ethereum to its own blockchain represents a significant milestone in the evolving landscape of digital assets. By introducing innovative solutions like built-in royalties and ‚ÄúFuel Tanks,‚Äù Enjin is not only enhancing the user experience but also setting a new standard for NFT transactions and management. The strategic approach to migration, spearheaded by Atlas Development Services, showcases a forward-thinking method to overcome the challenges of high gas fees, a common barrier in the blockchain world. This move, coupled with the potential for broader adoption of blockchain in the gaming industry as highlighted by industry experts, positions Enjin at the forefront of NFT innovation.

If so, you may want to look at signing up for the free course currently being offered by the University of Nicosia (UNIC) in Cyprus. According to the UNIC website, the course is ‚Äúdelivered on-chain and in the metaverse‚Äù. It began in October and continues into January. Although the course is well underway, it is self-paced, so if you have enough time to set aside over the holidays, you can still sign up and complete the Metaverse certification. Furthermore, the course material is uploaded to Github as the curriculum progresses. You can find it here. The course, META 501: NFTs and the Metaverse come with an official ‚ÄúUniversity of Nicosia Certificate of Completion‚Äù NFT, on the Ethereum blockchain. To get your Metaverse certificate, you must complete the course and pass the multiple-choice test at the end of the period. Lectures are given by the UNIC faculty, headed by Professor George Giaglas, and Punk6529, a leading NFT and Metaverse investor, who April opened a Metaverse museum. Learning occurs in virtual reality auditoriums within ‚ÄúOM‚Äù, an Open Metaverse built by Punk6529. There is also a veritable array of star guest lecturers, including big hitters such as Keith Grossman, President of Forbes, Yat Siu, Chairman of Animoca Brands, and NFT artist, Beeple. There are too many to name here, but the list includes trailblazers, influencers and companies investing in the Metaverse and NFT space. You can browse the guest lecturers and their expertise on the university website. Why take the ‚ÄúNFTs and the Metaverse‚Äù course? The Metaverse is the next evolution of the internet and will majorly impact many aspects of society, including business, work, governing, personal and social relationships. Moreover, an integral part of the coming Metaverse is NFTs. Therefore, the modules included in META 501 will help learners understand the skill sets needed to succeed in the Metaverse and give them an introductory foundation of the basics behind the theory and current use cases for the emerging technologies surrounding both. You may think that the Metaverse is a long way off, and yes, a fully functional inter-operable metaverse is still not technologically feasible but an S\u0026P 500 company, Gartner, predicts that some 25% of people will be active within the evolving Metaverse, for at least one hour a day. What other free courses do UNIC offer? UNIC is also offering a further two free MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) starting in the new year. The first MOOC is an introductory course to Decentralized Finance which begins on 9th January 2023. The second offering is BLOC-511DL: Digital Currency, which commences on 6th February 2023. You can find more info on signing up for the DeFi course here and if you wish to enrol in the free Blockchain course check this page out. The OM What modules are included in NFTs and the Metaverse? The first seven weeks are focused on NFTs and include lectures on copyright, provenance, and tax laws concerning NFTs. The Crypto and Generative art NFTs modules cover subjects such as cross-over artists and photography and the history and future direction of generative art. Another module covering gaming NFTs includes lectures on in-game economics, play-to-earn games, and the differences between blockchain and traditional gaming. The second half of the course relates to the NFTs in the Metaverse. The first lectures give you a grounding in the history of the early Metaverse, plus lectures on MMORPGs, virtual reality systems and metaverse social networks. Another set of lectures includes learning about 3D in the Metaverse. Subjects relate to propriety game engines and Web3 standards. Further lectures concentrate on moves to create immersive experiences for users through virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), extended reality, virtual worlds and how virtual environments will grow. Other subjects taught are metaverse-related business opportunities, business laws, and protecting your brand in the Metaverse. The final lectures relate to web 1 and 2 technology stacks and the future of Web3 technology stacks such as Wed3 apps and Open Standards. About the University of Nicosia The university has a good reputation and is ranked the No. 1 University in the Southern Mediterranean for tuition in English, with Times Higher Education ranking the UNIC at 501#, overall globally. Moreover, it has a long association with blockchain technology, becoming the World‚Äôs first university to offer credits for blockchain courses, back in 2014. Currently, the university offers two crypto-related degrees, an MSc in Blockchain and Digital Currency and an MSc in Computer Science ‚Äì Blockchain Concentration. In addition, it hopes to introduce an MSc in Metaverse Systems in 2023. Afterthoughts on courses to learn metaverse skills As Web3 technology evolves, people will live a mixed reality life, seamlessly moving between the real world and the virtual world. These future immersive worlds will include new digital technology and business, work and social opportunities. The UNIC, NFTs and the Metaverse certificate is an excellent way to develop the Metaverse skills needed to be successful, in virtual environments. The set-up, UNIC, and the lecturers involved combine to give the course weight and authority. Finally, when the course is completed it will still be available for open access.

Launched in 2020, Async Art quickly became a hub for innovative artists and musicians, offering a unique platform for creative expression. The platform‚Äôs unique selling point was its dynamic approach to digital art. Artists were empowered to create multi-layered, constantly evolving pieces that could evolve over time or be influenced by collectors. This interactive aspect set Async Art apart from other platforms in the blockchain art space. Key Features and Innovations One of Async Art‚Äôs most significant contributions to the Web3 community was the Blueprints system. This tool provided artists with a template to create generative NFTs without any coding knowledge. The result was a flurry of iconic projects, including XCOPY‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrifters‚Äù and ‚ÄúAcross the Face‚Äù by Osinachi. These projects showcased the potential of the Blueprint system, offering a glimpse of what the future of digital art could look like. The Challenges of a Changing Landscape Despite its successes, Async Art faced numerous challenges. The NFT space has grown exponentially in a short time, leading to a shift in the industry‚Äôs motivations. When we launched in Feb 2020, the NFT world was smaller and simpler. Everyone knew each other and there was a genuine sense of altruism all around. I was eager to join and contribute ideas and tech with a community that shared my values of innovation, collaboration, and equity. ‚Äî Conlan Rios (conlan.eth) üá∫üá¶üïäüî∫ (@conlan) October 23, 2023 As Async Art‚Äôs CEO, Conlan Rios, tweeted, the journey wasn‚Äôt without its hurdles. Shifting from an art collector and community builder to a technical platform operator and team leader brought new challenges and responsibilities, some of which were less glamorous than others. ‚ÄúGo where you‚Äôre celebrated, not tolerated.‚Äù This has been a tough one, but the @AsyncArt team and I have made the hard decision to begin winding down operations. The Closure Announcement After careful consideration, Async Art announced on Oct. 23 that it would be winding down operations over the next few months. This news marked the end of an era for the blockchain art community, but the team was confident that the dynamic and generative art movement would continue to thrive. After much deliberation, it is with heavy hearts that we announce Async Art is winding down operations over the next few months. What Happens to Existing NFTs? Following the closure announcement, one of the most pressing questions was what would happen to the existing NFTs. Fortunately, Async Art had a plan in place. All Async NFTs are secured on IPFS and will continue to exist on-chain. However, the Async Market will no longer support purchases by the end of 2023, and Async Art will stop accepting new submissions starting Oct. 23. Despite the impending closure, Rios assured that the team‚Äôs primary goal was to ‚Äúpreserve the works created with [the] platform and ensure [its] remaining team members find new homes to continue pursuing their web3 passions.‚Äù Conclusion While Async Art‚Äôs closure marks the end of an era, it also serves as a reminder of the platform‚Äôs significant contributions to the Web3 community. The legacy of Async Art will continue to inspire and influence the dynamic and generative art movement for years to come. The crypto art community will undoubtedly feel the loss of Async Art, but as the saying goes, ‚ÄúEvery end is a new beginning.‚Äù As we bid farewell to Async Art, we look forward to the future of digital art and NFTs with anticipation and excitement.

Source My Neighbor Alice Reflecting on the transition of My Neighbor Alice to Chromia‚Äôs Appnet, Riccardo Sibani, the Chief Product Officer of the game, shared his insights. ‚ÄúWe are committed to the development of open and interoperable metaverses. Utilizing Chromia, we are crafting a game that embodies true decentralization and operates entirely on-chain. Transitioning to Appnet represents a fundamental step in our vision: Power to the Players.‚Äù An exciting feature of My Neighbor Alice on Chromia‚Äôs Appnet is the successful token bridging from an EVM-based network to Chromia.

Dapps hosted on the Appnet will transition to the Chromia Mainnet 1.0 following its launch in 2024. With Chromia‚Äôs recent unveiling of a new roadmap that includes the release of its public mainnet, the future seems promising for blockchain gaming and decentralized applications.

These pieces, converted into digital format and tokenized, have fetched more than $2.5 million. One particular NFT inspired by a Van Gogh painting was sold for $1.3 million, whereas the second one fetched consecutive $1.27 million at an auction. The digitized artworks, identified as numbers 132 and 283, attracted heavy interest. The size of the winning bids was 35.9999 BTC and 34.9999 BTC on the Bitcoin network respectively. This signifies a recent surge in buyers, on the edges of a wider trend that sees NFTs themed after Vincent van Gogh become highly sought-after commodities in the market. The Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay‚Äôs NFT Initiative In response to the growing interest in Van Gogh-inspired NFTs, Paris‚Äô Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay announced plans to conceive unique NFTs inspired by the Dutch post-impressionist painter‚Äôs works. These NFTs will be minted on the Tezos blockchain and will come in two primary forms: an augmented reality experience and a digital art piece conceptualized by French artist KERU. Looking ahead to the future, from 2024, Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay openly plans to invite digital artists to exploit the blockchain technology. This is aimed at encouraging the creation of collections inspired by the museum‚Äôs permanent exhibits. Market Dynamics Significantly, this recent surge in sales comes after a period of notable downturn in the NFT market, prompting some observers to argue that there is a revival currently taking place. The high sales have also indicated that NFT collections on the Bitcoin network are starting to achieve considerably more than those on the Ethereum network. This could mark a potential shift in the platform preferences of digital artists and collectors alike. The allure of Van Gogh, paired with the innovative potential of NFT technology, may just be the catalyst for further growth and evolution of the digital art world.

As with any emerging industry, it is fraught with uncertainty, volatility, and a steep learning curve. Factors such as fluctuating market values, concerns over intellectual property rights, and the evolving regulatory landscape often pose challenges to both creators and investors. One significant challenge for platforms like Gala Music is ensuring the authenticity and originality of the NFTs. As the market grows, so does the potential for counterfeit or duplicated tokens. Establishing a rigorous verification process becomes paramount to maintain the trust of both artists and consumers. Moreover, environmental concerns related to the energy consumption of blockchain, the underlying technology for NFTs, have raised eyebrows. Critics point out the significant energy use of blockchain networks, which can offset the potential advantages of digital art and music platforms. Conclusion Despite the concerns, it‚Äôs evident that the benefits offered by the NFT market ‚Äî decentralization, direct artist-to-fan interactions, and the ability to monetize digital art ‚Äî outweigh the challenges for many. Platforms like Gala Music provide artists with an opportunity to retain more revenue from their creations and engage directly with their fan base without intermediaries. While the road ahead for the NFT market has its share of bumps, the success and growth of platforms like Gala Music indicate a promising future. As more artists and fans embrace this new paradigm, we can expect further innovations and solutions to the challenges currently faced.

This expansion, through its Metaverse Shopping Mall and the addition of Spatial, aims to enhance graphical quality and accessibility across various devices, including desktop, mobile, and VR. With the Metaverse e-commerce market projected to reach a staggering US$2.6 trillion by 2030, as estimated by McKinsey, this platform extension aims to offer a competitive edge to merchants lacking a Metaverse presence. Innovative Engagement in the Metaverse Following the successful launch of the Worldline Metaverse Shopping Mall in Decentraland earlier this year, Worldline‚Äôs integration of Spatial marks creating a comprehensive Metaverse Shopping Hub. Spatial‚Äôs Season 2 introduces new customer engagement methods through gaming. For instance, merchants can host virtual scavenger hunts where customers collect digital eggs for NFT rewards. Source Spatial Worldline Shopping Mall Furthermore, this initiative signifies the start of inventive customer interaction methods in the Metaverse. By diversifying engagement strategies, Worldline aims to strengthen the relationships between merchants and customers in this new digital realm. The Worldline Metaverse Shopping Mall, complemented by additional Metaverse Advertising, Phygital Experiences, and Augmented Reality packages, could help merchants establish and expand their Metaverse presence. Enhanced Accessibility and Payment Solutions Spatial‚Äôs integration notably improves accessibility, allowing entry into the Metaverse via VR headsets and smartphones, not just computers. Worldline‚Äôs platform supports various payment methods, including traditional cards, E-wallets like PayPal, and mobile payments through Apple Pay. Sascha Muenger, Head Competence Center Crypto-Related Products \u0026 Metaverse at Worldline, expressed enthusiasm about this new phase, saying, ‚ÄúWe are delighted to present the second season of our Metaverse Shopping Mall in Spatial. This important milestone gives us the opportunity to create a new shopping experience together with some of our most innovative customers and take another step towards commerce solutions in the Metaverse.‚Äù The launch also signals a geographical expansion. PAYONE, a collaboration between Worldline and the German Savings Banks Association (DSV Group), will distribute the Worldline Metaverse solution in Germany and Austria in the first quarter of 2024. This move is expected to bring this global innovation to vital local markets, further scaling the Worldline Metaverse Shopping Mall and introducing more merchants to the Metaverse as a new channel for commerce. Final Thoughts As the Metaverse emerges as a significant venue for digital commerce, businesses and individuals will begin to adapt and embrace the new possibilities presented by this interconnected virtual world. By staying informed and engaged with the latest innovations and trends, merchants can make the most of every opportunity available to them in the ever-evolving landscape of the Metaverse.

These regulations require that investors earn interest on digital assets deposited into exchanges, though NFTs and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are not included in the new law. The FSC highlighted that under certain conditions, NFTs, typically excluded, could be classified as virtual assets eligible for interest on exchanges if used as a payment method and issued in large quantities. New Protocols for Virtual Asset Operators The FSC‚Äôs notice also specifies new protocols for virtual asset operators handling user deposits. Exchanges must separate user funds from their assets and entrust them to a bank, with a mandate that at least 80% of coins be stored in cold wallets to improve security. Furthermore, the guidance addresses contingency plans for security breaches, requiring virtual asset service providers to have insurance or reserve funds. The law also limits suspending deposits or withdrawals, only permitting such actions under extreme necessity or legal directives. As part of a broader effort to regulate the cryptocurrency space, South Korean financial regulators have been urging the public to report unlicensed crypto exchanges. This campaign, led by the Digital Asset Exchange Association and the Financial Intelligence Unit, signifies South Korea‚Äôs dedication to a secure, regulated digital asset marketplace. Final Thoughts With the advent of blockchain technology, the scope of ‚Äòdigital assets‚Äò has broadened to encompass various investable forms like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and tokenized assets, including real estate. The term now commonly refers to assets underpinned by distributed ledger technology rather than just digital media files. The tokenization of tangible assets like real estate and commodities has led to evolving dynamics in digital asset marketplaces, with governments worldwide adapting to these changes in the digital asset space.

AI-Enhanced Educational Game Development One of the primary features introduced is the AI-powered game generation tool, specifically designed to assist educators in swiftly creating games based on topic-specific prompts. Drawing from an expansive data pool accumulated over the past decade, these AI tools generate games that are both age-appropriate and educationally relevant. According to Yogev Shelly, CEO of TinyTap, the beta version of these tools currently focuses on single-topic prompts. However, there are plans for future iterations to understand and generate games based on complex, multi-faceted prompts. Incorporating NFTs to Add Value to Educational Content Scheduled to launch in the fourth quarter of the year, TinyTap is collaborating with Open Campus to offer an interesting crossover between NFTs and education. NFT and EDU token holders will have the ability to mint TinyTap games into NFTs. The objective of this integration is to add a new layer of liquidity to the education sector, providing educators with an expanded set of opportunities for content distribution and monetization. Confluence of AI, Blockchain, and Future Ed-Tech Trends Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, believes that AI and NFTs can play a significant role in shaping the future of educational technology. He states that the inclusion of these technologies into TinyTap‚Äôs platform marks a progression towards what he calls a ‚Äúsmart education system‚Äù. This emerging model of education could integrate other advanced technologies like blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations, along with AI, to offer a more comprehensive educational experience. In summary, the latest additions to the TinyTap platform reflect the growing trend of leveraging advanced technologies to improve and augment the educational experience. While the AI tools focus on making educational game development more efficient and adaptable, the integration of NFTs aims to diversify opportunities for educators in the realm of content distribution and value creation. Both initiatives offer a glimpse into the potential future of education, one increasingly influenced by technological advancements.

It‚Äôs still in its early phases and expanding exceptionally quickly. To build your first NFT collection and solidify a position in this industry before it becomes oversaturated, you must learn how to create and market your own NFTs. This article will help you through the process of it. What are NFTs? NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that reside on the blockchain. Just like other decentralized applications that run on a blockchain, NFTs also operate on Web3 browsers, which is helpful in keeping remote security. Each NFT is unique, and one cannot trade it for another cryptocurrency, unlike other cryptos where you can exchange a fungible acquisition for another of similar value. It contains a digital signature to demonstrate ownership and authenticity. Cross-referencing the metadata with openly available blockchain records is another way to confirm that someone is the owner of an authentic NFT. NFTs thrive on scarcity. They become more valuable over time since they include a digital signature. According to fundamental economic theory, a product or service‚Äôs price will increase when there is a shortage compared to demand. That explains why many people dream of owning an NFT because doing so gives them the same pride as buying a Van Gogh painting. How to Build Your First NFT Collection Whether music, a painting, or a piece of literature, you can turn any digital file into an NFT. Below, we curated some steps to build your first NFT collection, upload it, and sell it. Create a digital art draft There are no guidelines for digital art, so you can be as creative as you like without adhering to any particular technique. You can use programs like Photoshop, Affinity Pro, and Corel Painter to create digital art. However, you can hire freelancers online if you want expertly curated work. Before getting your art into an NFT platform, you must be aware that the marketplace must support the file you‚Äôre uploading. Most platforms support TXT, PNG, JPG, MP4, and GIF files. Choose a blockchain The next step is to mint the digital artwork into an NFT after choosing which one to utilize. Minting means creating a digital file into a cryptocurrency collectible or digital asset kept on the blockchain. And the most crucial stage, which affects the cost of minting an NFT and the security of your NFT, is choosing an appropriate blockchain. Additionally, because specific wallets are incompatible with certain blockchains, you might be unable to move your NFT to your digital wallet if you mint it on a less well-known blockchain. Before choosing a blockchain for your NFT, know the best and most well-known ones first. Ethereum The most widely used blockchain is Ethereum, which is known for being straightforward and user-friendly. Many popular NFT marketplaces are based on the Ethereum network, including OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, and others. However, you will need to pay a significant amount known as gas costs to validate any transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Because of this, Ethereum is frequently the most expensive platform for producing NFTs. Polygon Using Polygon, you may mint NFTs on OpenSea, one of the largest marketplaces. Unique to Polygon is the ability to mint NFTs without paying anything upfront. The platform presupposes lazy minting as the default strategy, which means the person purchasing your NFT will be responsible for paying the fees to have it minted and will charge you 2.5% of every transaction you perform on the network Tezos Tezos can be the solution you‚Äôre looking for if you‚Äôre worried about how blockchains will affect the environment because it has been shown to use 200,000 times less energy than competing systems and produce a smaller overall carbon footprint. Other than that, Tezos is an excellent blockchain for minting NFTs, even for beginners, because minting NFTs on it is quicker, cheaper, and more efficient than on Ethereum. Prepare and fill up your crypto wallet As indicated, you will have to pay a modest sum of tokens as transaction costs to sell your NFTs. You‚Äôll need to create a wallet that supports your preferred blockchain to achieve that. Additionally, in the world of NFT, your wallet address serves as your identification. Use it to set up a profile on online stores and other decentralized applications. The best crypto wallets out there are Coinbase, MetaMask, and Rainbow. Create a marketplace account After finishing the prior procedures, select a marketplace where you will present all of your work. There are a few things to think about in advance: All devices should be able to access the platform for convenience. It should support various wallets and payment methods for a simple transaction. The market should support token fractionalization. It should have a robust verification procedure to safeguard your assets. It should optionally offer specific user incentives. OpenSea For all kinds of NFTs, OpenSea is well-liked and straightforward to operate. OpenSea now offers a slow mint option, whereas the Ethereum blockchain is infamous for demanding exorbitant service costs, or ‚Äúgas.‚Äù Without having to pay for gas, the artist can upload their creation, ‚Äúmint‚Äù it to their profile, and then put it for sale. The gas costs will be covered by the collector when they buy it. Rarible Book, music, digital art, and movie creators can all use Rarible to mint their NFT works. There are some amusing options, like the option only to provide buyers access to the entire project while allowing visitors to have a ‚Äúsneak peek‚Äù of your product, but limit the whole project to the purchasers. Holaplex Artists and creators report that the Solana blockchain is extremely quick, has excellent performance, and is cost-effective with meager fees, despite Solana receiving mixed reviews from Ethereum aficionados. Solana is known as a new, less harmful alternative to Ethereum due to its speed and efficiency, which also reduces energy consumption. Objkt Objkt, first developed as a secondary market, now enables artists and producers to make money directly from their work on its site. Sasha Stiles and Ana Maria Caballero, co-founders of the VerseVerse, use it and other literary NFT creators. Get your first NFT minted and listed After creating the digital artwork, connecting it to a marketplace, picking a blockchain, and purchasing some cryptocurrency, all that‚Äôs left to do is mint it. It is the process of turning a digital file into a blockchain-based digital asset. Your digital asset cannot be erased or modified once registered on the blockchain. You should be able to find step-by-step instructions for posting your digital file on your preferred NFT marketplace, and once minted, your digital artwork is now open for sale. Selling your NFTs Now that you know how to make an NFT, you must set up the sales procedure. You should factor fees into the minimum price calculation. If you set the price too low, you risk losing money on sales. It is frequently impossible and costly to mint or sells an NFT. There may be a commission charge for the sale and a transaction fee when transferring from the buyers‚Äô wallet to yours. Due to the erratic nature of bitcoin values, fees might change. It would be best if you considered the cost of minting and selling your NFT to ensure you can sell it for a price that pays for all expenses. After you complete this process, your NFT will be listed, and other collectors may begin bidding on your assets. If your item is unique, you may sell your NFT. Bottom Line If you‚Äôre a beginner to NFTs, it‚Äôs justified that you may feel overwhelmed with the process. However, there‚Äôs a big misconception that you must be technical to participate in crypto. Instead, consider NFTs a fun approach to entering the market that doesn‚Äôt require coding knowledge.

This indicates a bullish trend in the crypto markets, signaling renewed investor interest. According to DappRadar, the average value of NFT transactions witnessed a significant increase of 114% within the month, jumping from $126 to $270. Consistent Upward Momentum The NFT industry has shown consistent upward momentum for the second consecutive month. In November, the trading volume surged by 125%. This pattern represents a notable change in user behavior, contrasting with previous downturns in NFT trading. Analytics firm Nansen has reported continual weekly increases in NFT sales volumes since October. Sales rose from $56 million in the week ending October 9, to $129 million by the week ending November 5. This steady rise underlines a growing market confidence. In addition, there‚Äôs been a notable increase in daily unique active wallets (UAW) in blockchain gaming. A 14% rise has been observed, along with a 34% market dominance in the decentralized applications sector. This uptick highlights the growing interest in blockchain-based gaming. Investments in Blockchain Gaming Despite the prevalent bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market throughout the year, blockchain gaming projects have remarkably defied this trend. Since the onset of 2023 leading up to October, these innovative gaming ventures have successfully attracted substantial investments totaling $2.3 billion. This influx of capital underscores the growing investor belief in the long-term potential of blockchain gaming as a sector. A closer examination of the investment timeline reveals a concentrated spike in funding during the third quarter of 2023. In this period alone, an impressive $600 million was poured into blockchain gaming projects. This surge in investments during a single quarter illustrates a robust confidence among investors, despite the broader market‚Äôs volatility. It suggests a recognition of the unique value proposition that blockchain gaming offers, including aspects like in-game NFTs, decentralized gaming economies, and player-driven governance. Rise of NFTs and Blockchain Gaming: The NFT market and blockchain gaming sectors are evidently entering a robust and dynamic phase. The marked increase in NFT trading volumes and the significant flow of investments into blockchain gaming projects are strong indicators of this trend. This uptrend reflects a renewed investor confidence, particularly noteworthy given the past year‚Äôs challenging market conditions. The resilience and growth of these sectors suggest a deeper market maturation and a growing acknowledgement of the intrinsic value of digital assets and decentralized gaming experiences. Looking ahead, these developments point towards a potentially flourishing market. As more investors and users become attuned to the possibilities inherent in NFTs and blockchain gaming, these sectors are poised for further expansion and innovation. The ongoing investment and increasing trade volumes signal not just a recovery, but a vibrant, evolving landscape for digital assets and decentralized gaming ecosystems.
